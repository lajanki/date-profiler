I like my artsy with a little bit of fartsy. I love Sundays spent drinking massive amounts of coffee and lingering over newspapers and comics (yes, I read comics). And my Friday nights? Well you’ll just have to wait and see won’t you? Favorite Movie: An American Tale: Fievel Goes West. What can I say? I love that damn mouse and always had a thing for cowboys. Favorite Place: The fort I made in my basement when I was 11. My parents let me keep that thing up for a full eight  months and it was magic. Favorite Food: Cheetos. Puffs. I don’t know what y’all are thinking with that crunchy crap.
