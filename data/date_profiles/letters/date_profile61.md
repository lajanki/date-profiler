I’m just a girl with a masters degree that is virtually useless. I am definitely old fashioned about dating, but by no means a prude. Don’t get me wrong. I’m a gymnast so I bend like wet spaghetti in the sack. I share my apartment with my cat, Joker, who I share all of my secrets with. So be careful of what you tell me. Joker knows all. There’s nothing hotter than a guy who loves spending time on crosswords. Get it... down? I also enjoy puns very much.

 * My favorite movie is Homeward Bound, but I don’t usually admit it.
 * My favorite things to do consist of crosswords, pun and games (wink!) and traveling.
 * I’m looking for a down to earth guy who loves to stay in and relax with a good cup of joe.
