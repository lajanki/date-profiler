Hey there, my name's Dave. According to my sister, the girls I've met in the real world have been less-than-stellar (even though I thought my dating life was perfectly fine!). So at her request, I've decided to try something completely new and jump into the world of online dating. Here goes...

I'm 28 years old and work as a unit clerk at a local hospital. I can honestly say that I love my job because it gives me the opportunity to connect with people on a daily basis. I work the night shift, which sometimes gets a bad rap, but it also comes with many lifestyle perks. Imagine the luxury of going grocery shopping at 10 AM on a Wednesday morning: fully stocked shelves, no lines... it's a beautiful thing! :)

I am very close to my family and I make sure to spend at least one day a week doing something fun with my siblings. Whether we're watching a movie, playing soccer or jamming on the piano, we always have an amazing time together.

I like to focus my energy on collecting experiences as opposed to 'things' and would much rather spend my money on a trip to a foreign country than on a fancy new car. I'm the type of person who likes to seize opportunities and make the most of every day. Above all else, I value honesty and kindness in a partner, so if you're a genuine person with a lust for life, send me a message!
