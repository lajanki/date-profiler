I have scaled Mount Everest and stood on the summit, looking at the gorgeous view, having goose bumps, wiping a cold, red nose, thinking to myself, "Wow! "Is it cold or is it cold"! "What a view! It's to die for!"

Although my friends say I have a knack for talking my head off most times, I've had my moments of speechlessness. One being the moment I described above, another being my first scuba diving experience. Not that I had much choice in the second moment, really. 

### My Qualities
This being a profile, I have to list a few of my qualities, so here goes:
I'm physically fit, pretty much an extrovert, very nomadic, and enjoy a never-give-up attitude! I do not run from adversity, and really come into my own in the face of danger (this one I gathered from my friends), restlessness (unfortunate, but is the case nonetheless), and I tend to get a little cranky if I go for months without any activity/adventure.

### I Love...
Adventure - in any form, at any time! 
Traveling - Been to Nepal to scale Everest, to New Zealand to bungee jump, and currently in Sri Lanka teaching scuba diving.
Food - LOVE. EATING. GREAT. FOOD. Quite the foodie.

### What I'm Looking For...
I'm looking for a fellow feminine adventure junkie to share my life and adventures with. Lately I've realized that having adventures with someone is much more thrilling than having them all alone. So if you can relate to any of the above, and if you share a few qualities with me, then contact me. Looking forward to hearing from you!
