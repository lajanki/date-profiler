I don’t like most guys, but... I am not interested in most guys and besides perhaps that what makes those few unique individuals that I do connect with all the more special.

Myself – restless, analytical and opinionated. I am not offended by a dirty joke and can dish out one of my own. I am independent but far from being a feminist. Sarcasm is a spice of life, so bring it on. Timeless books and movies that make you wonder for days about whose side you are on put great flavor into many of my evenings. What’s your story? What are your greatest pet-peeves and what makes you weak in your knees from joy and happiness.
