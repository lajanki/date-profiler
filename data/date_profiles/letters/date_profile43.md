Weird things happen to me; nothing that you should be afraid of, just realize that if we get together, you're in for a wild ride. I've driven a go-cart for six laps with the back of the car in flames. My VW has broken down in front of dozens of honking customers in the drive-thru lane at McDonald's on many occasions.

I spent my days getting press coverage for people in the film industry, but the truth is, I'd rather be making my own headlines as a writer. My ultimate goal is to move to LA to write comedy, but it won't be easy to leave my family behind because they are my anchor and the paradigm of everything that I aspire to be.

I love staying up late, whether it's to party or just to read a good book, but I almost always sleep in on the weekends. I definitely have an adventurous streak, whether it's trying out an exotic recipe, running the dogs, or travelling the world. Oh, my dream trip has got to be travelling the orient express from Paris to Venice to Budapest, and then relaxing on some remote Greek island, You In?

My idea of a first date is simple really. After already having gelled on the phone I, as you open your door and even before our eyes meet, I kiss you, whisk you off your feet into my arms (before you faint), put you over my shoulder and escort you to my Ferrari. (Note to oneself: Don't you DARE try this, some fantasies are best left as fantasies).

So anyway to wrap this short intro up, my idea of the perfect relationship would be consummate companionship, exceptional generosity and an unrestrained love which will provide the base for a long-term relationship. Any questions welcome.
