Happy, healthy, loving, 25 year old looking for a great guy. I'm at a great place in my life. 

I love music and going to see it live so it would be nice to meet someone who enjoys that. No, I'm not referring to Carrie Underwood concerts. More like Avett Bros, Band of Horses, WSP, Kings of Leon, etc. I've been a brunette my entire life and decided to completely change my hair color a few weeks ago. I'm having fun with it. Pandora is pretty much the best thing ever. I love an ice cold Stella in a bottle. I was a debutante. Ray charles was born in my hometown. 

Cooking is a passion and there's nothing better than a kitchen full of friends, food and wine. Seriously though, there's nothing better!
