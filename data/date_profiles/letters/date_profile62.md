I am definitely not very down to earth. If you ignore me I might show up at your house unexpectedly to check in. I have a great fear of heights, so don’t worry about my climbing up any fire escapes. I love tea, coffee and anything else with caffeine in it. It’s the only thing that keeps me going throughout the day. I have a consistent urge to do everything properly all of the time. I don’t have time for mistakes. So if you swipe right, don’t make me regret it.
