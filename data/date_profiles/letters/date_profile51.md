Sometimes I feel like I’m an amature everything. I cook, road bike, paint occasionally, blog even less often, love snow sports, and am always looking to try new things and learn new things.

But I never really master anything! I like to think that makes my resume diverse, but you can give me a hard time about it if you’d like. If you can quote Neil Gaiman, keep up with me on a road bike, and show me something I haven’t tried before you should definitely message me.
