I am an amateur of all trades! I am an aspiring chef, a would-be skateboarder and an attempted blogger. I just like to try everything once and always enjoy learning new things. If you can show me something new and challenging that I haven’t tried, I look forward to hearing from you! I’m a part time nurse and am going to school for my MBA. In my spare time, when I’m not meeting interesting new people, I like doing charity work for the homeless. Maybe that sounds corny, but I have a story there and if you want to know the shocking tale of betrayal and revenge, just ask!
