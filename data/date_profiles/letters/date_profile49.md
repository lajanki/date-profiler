You know that person in your group of friends who is always planning something but maybe gets a little too crazy about it sometimes? Well, that’s me. I’m an event planner by trade and love everything about it. Putting together experiences for people is great, but I like to create my own too! Perfect dates are going for a hike, followed by a visit to a new local brewery or trying a new dinner spot and taking a walk nearby. I work hard during the week, fill my weekends with activities, and definitely can be a big ball of energy at times. I’m looking for a guy who can keep up and keep me on my toes.
