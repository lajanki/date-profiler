ABOUT ME:

As a person I like to think of myself as confident but not a ****. I’m a very humble man. I understand that there’s a time to give and be loving and understanding. I also believe in standing up for what I believe and not being walked on. I’m always there for my friends and loved ones. I don’t run from adversity. I care what people think of me because I believe in being the best man I can be. I want people who come across me to think “hey what a cool guy”. It’s not about attention for me. It’s about the importance of ones own honor and respect for those around him.

GOALS:

Looking to find a way into the music business. At what capacity, I’m not sure yet but I’m exploring many ideas. I really want to find a woman to love and share in the beauty that is life. I also want to continue to help those around me I care for to achieve their goals.

WHAT MAKES ME DIFFERENT:

I was raised by a single mother. Watched her get hurt many times. Made me believe how important it is to treat a woman right. My mother also taught me how to have inner strength and not to get walked on. I’m covered in tattoos and it’s made me understand just how fickle society is. I’m a TRUE heavy metal fan. I’ve had to overcome some shitty things in life and in doing so it’s made me a much stronger man.

Music: As I’ve already stated I’m a huge Heavy Metal fan. I’m a guitar tech (in training) for the signed band. I’m very passionate about the tattooed and heavy metal communities. We get a bad rap sometimes and it’s a shame cause there’s some really beautiful people within these realms of society.
