Originally from Australia, Iâ€™ve been living in the U.S. for a long time. I travel a lotâ€“for my job as a journalist, and also just because I love the surprise of the unknown. I love to learn about new places, people and cultures.

Iâ€™m the father of a grown son who is off at college. I like to be in harmony with the world around me. Wow, that sounds new age, but Iâ€™m very down to earth ðŸ˜‰ I like to read a lot and keep up with many thingsâ€“politics, social issues, culture, travels, people.

I especially value humor, being able to laugh at yourself, being able to communicate, culture in general, social issues, staying healthy, and the freedom to think out of the box.

I also like Woody Allen films, swimming, hearing peopleâ€™s stories, and simply talking with people.

Iâ€™m looking for a companionâ€“somone with her own life, with a strong personality, yet also able to make the compromises that life sometimes requires. Someone who isnâ€™t too thin and who is able to laugh at herself. No smokers, please.
