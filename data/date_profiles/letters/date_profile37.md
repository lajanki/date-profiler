I graduated from a five-year masters program in architecture three years ago. I'm career-driven and want success in every aspect of my life. I'm very adventurous and like to live life on the edge. The words random and spontaneous describe me well. I'm pretty much game for anything. 
 
For example, I decided to dye my hair red... at 2AM with my best friend a couple days ago. Another example is when I decided to move to New York, find a new job and an apartment all within a week. Or lastly, when I moved to Switzerland - I decided a month before I ended up leaving. I just love doing things without notice. 

I have a passion for traveling and would love to experience more diverse cultures. I've traveled a lot in Europe, all over the United States, Puerto Rico, and Canada. I plan to go to South Africa next January and I'm eager to see the rest of the world.
