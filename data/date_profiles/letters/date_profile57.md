About me: My name is Jenna and I’m 24 years old. I never pictured myself as the online dating type, but at this point in my life I thought ‘Screw it, why the f#$% not!” I’m a very busy person so I don’t have a lot of time to go out and meet people. So here I am.

I work as a Vets assistant so I must warn you I do have to put thermometers up butts sometimes. But that’s a plus for you, because if you ever get sick I can take your temp very easily! 😉

I am not a huge fan of cooking, but I sure as hell do love to eat! Eating is one of my favorite hobbies of all time. I can do it all day, every day. So I’m looking for someone who can feed me and eat with me constantly. However, I must say I make some pretty delicious toaster strudels upon request. I’m also really great at boiling water.

I have 2 dogs, they are like my children! I love them with all of my heart. You must love dogs to be with me. Don’t bother messaging me if you don’t approve. I will not, under any circumstance, get rid of them. Yes, I am crazy dog lady and I choose dogs over men any day.

My interests: Kicking ass and taking names. Hiking, but only the short kind. Reading magazines while my boo cooks for me. I’ll clean up after. I’m a great singer, but my sister always tells me I sound the best when no one else is around.

My dislikes: People who chew too loudly. Men who don’t cook. People who smell bad.
