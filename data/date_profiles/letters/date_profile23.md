I can get on with pretty much anyone, I'm not obsessed with myself, I wear my PJ's all day after a night out and I couldn't live off salads

I love spending time with my family & friends, travelling, being spontaneous, I enjoy good food, good company and  good music to have a dance to. (a night raving on the Biggmarket and a pasty from the 24hr Greggs afterwards is not for me I'm afraid, though I can't say I haven't tried it!)

If I don't like you I'll be polite and pleasant, If I do like you I will be sarcastic and tease you relentlessly... I think I have somehow gotten this backwards.
