The first thing people notice about me: I’m not wearing any pants. But then we leave the changing room at the gym and they’ll go, “Oh, cool. That scruffy-looking dude has some pretty great hair.”

Five things I couldn’t live without: Aforementioned haircut. Hairstylist of said haircut. Shampoo. Conditioner. Hat. (hey – we all have off days.)

The one thing I am most passionate about: Wait... I feel like we’ve covered this one already. Other than my lustrous mane, I’m most passionate about fish and chip night at my local tavern, ruining The Hunger Games for my little niece, and my workout play list.

The three things which I am most thankful for: My brother and sister and the adorable kids they let me spoil.

More about me: When I’m not rescuing kittens from trees and singing show tunes to old ladies (what can I say – I’m just a selfless dude), I’m catching up with friends, going to the symphony (yes, I promise), and pretending to be Jamie Oliver.

You should contact me if: You’re not allergic to musicians, sarcasm or witty repartee.
