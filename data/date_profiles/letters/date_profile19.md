Approach Hey folks, my name's Jessica. I assume you probably want to know a few things about me other than the fact that I like "hanging out with my friends" and "going on vacation", so here are a few random tidbits:

- I have a rewarding career that centers around one of my greatest passions (Hint: it may involve a small, Italian plumber named Mario :) 
- I LOVE green peppers! Not sure why, but they just make me feel so good inside. Especially on a thin crust pizza - yum! 
- Halloween is my favorite holiday. Each year I make my outfit from scratch, and I usually do really well in costume competitions.
- I have a 5 year old Sharpei named Kobe (yes, after the basketball player!) 
- I may have a minor Nutella addiction.
- I don't know what I would do without my older sister - she's my best friend and keeps me sane when life gets crazy.
- It has always been a dream of mine to do a road trip across the United States in an old Volkswagon. 
- I taught myself how to balance a bottle on my nose while standing on one foot. It's a completely useless skill, but occasionally wins me free drinks at the pub!
- I've been collecting stamps since I was 7 years old (kinda geeky, I know!). It was something I used to do with my grandmother, and now serves as a way to honor her memory.
- You get 10 bonus points if you think Def Leppard is the best band of all time!
