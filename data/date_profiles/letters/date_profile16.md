I'm a graduate of Texas Christian University, where I majored in Post-Modern Literature. Yup, that's right, reading is my biggest hobby. 80% of the time you'll find me with my nose deep in a book (except on Sunday nights from 9 - 10 PM when Breaking Bad is on - GO HEISENBERG!). 

Travelling is also a major passion of mine, and I spend a lot of my free-time planning out future adventures. I would love to travel through South America sometime, especially Argentina. Something about the culture just speaks to me... not to mention, they make fantastic wine. 

I have an 18 month old german shepherd named Ringo - he unfortunately lost one of his legs in a car accident, but he's still the cutest thing on the planet! I love animals and hope to meet someone who shares this passion. 

As for the kind of woman I'm looking for... she knows what she wants out of life and has her finances in check. She enjoys the outdoors, tries to eats healthy and likes to take a midnight stroll from time-to-time. 

Please Note: If you can't go 5 minutes without checking Facebook on your phone, we're probably not a good match. However, if you enjoy having thought-provoking conversation and aren't afraid of the occasional spirited debate, give me a shout!
