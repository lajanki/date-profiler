Ok, I’m not sure what to say but here are some fun facts for you:
- My dad was a military man and I couldn’t be prouder to be his daughter.
- I plan to open my own business in the next year or so.
- Once I ate a whole watermelon by myself because of a friend’s dare. It was surprisingly hard.
- My favorite beer is whatever IPA is on tap.
- I’m a cat person. They’re just so independent and furry.
- I really don’t have a type. As long as you have something interesting to say, I want to hear it.
- I’m a little old fashioned. If you open a door for me, I will melt.
