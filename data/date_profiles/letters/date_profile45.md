I really don't want to bore you to tears by writing about what a great catch I am. I'm sure you've read many dating profiles that have told you they are perfect for you! I've always believed that actions speak louder than words don't you think? It would be great to meet face to face for coffee and see where it goes from there. 

I'm not scared to let you know that I have flaws. I'm a perfectionist and can use a whole package of good paper trying to handwrite something. With the internet world taking over, it's nice to write an actual handwritten letter to family and friends. I know that recycling is huge so don't worry, I do use the paper I've scrapped for other things! You would think because I'm a perfectionist that I have the perfect job. That, I have not perfected yet. I'm still looking for my true calling and am taking part-time classes at the University after work. 

If you are honest and are looking to meet someone for casual dating, make sure to email me. I am looking to date but if it leads to something more, it's always a good thing. Don't forget to tell me something about yourself!
