"[Some people never;go crazy]. What truly horrible lives they must lead." -Charles Bukowski
I’m an outgoing [lady who loves;nightlife], weekend adventures, dancing, karaoke (I do [an amazing;Carrie Underwood]), [getting out on;the lake], and meeting new people. I probably [change my;mind] about a thousand times a day and will [keep you on;your toes], but [I like to think;I’m worth it]. For one, I’m an amazing cook if I do say so myself, and love to [try out new;recipes]. There’s just [nothing better than;getting creative] and making [something that you can;also eat]. [It’s the;best kind of art].
