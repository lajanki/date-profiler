You should probably know that [I always manage to;spill iced tea on myself] [despite my;best intentions]. [If you aren’t;horrified by that], [I think you’ll;enjoy hanging out with me]. I am a “call it like I see it” kind of girl and I speak fluent sarcasm. I’m also not really big into charming guys or girls. I’m more of the “[seduce you with;my awkwardness]” type of flirt. I love [my job as;a veterinarian] because I [get to;save lives and pet puppies]. [Two of the;best things ever]! Play your cards right and [maybe I’ll buy;you a drink at my favorite local bar]. [Don’t be;surprised] if I randomly quote Labyrinth.
