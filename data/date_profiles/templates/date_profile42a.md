My parents always wanted me [to be a;doctor], but I knew Information Technology was my true calling. I'm way cooler than [my geeky;friends] and way [geekier than;my cool friends].

[I tend to;stand out] wherever I am. I'm currently helping businesses design websites [to get more;customers]. [It's going;very, very well]. [I'm very;laid back], fun, and [easy to;get along with]. I have a lot of really interesting friends [who make my;life all that much better]. Some you probably wouldn't talk to, and [some who;probably wouldn't talk to you].

[I learned to;play guitar] at an early age and ever since playing that first G string, I was hooked. Jazz is my favorite. There's something soothing and deep about it that just speaks to my soul. And you get bonus points [if you can;sing off tune to my out of tune guitar]. I'm cocky. I've worked hard to achieve, learn and become who I am and that's [brought me;a lot of confidence]. I like the me that I am now much [better than the;old version of me]. [But don't;worry], [I don't think;I'm better than you]. Your amazing girl parts [give you;triple points] from the word 'go'!
