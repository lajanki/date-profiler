[Here's my;background check]:

- [I work; in a large law firm]
- In my free time I like to [listen to;something relaxing], [hit the;gym], and [enjoy a;nice meal]
- My goal in life is to find a way to [make myself;a better person]

If you've made it this far, I hope the above is good enough because [I really don't;know what to say]. The best advice I ever got was to just be yourself. So if someone told me to describe myself in 500 words or less so women could be [attracted to;me]... I'd probably tell them if a woman liked me after only 500 words - [she must;be nuts]! I'm not here [to play;games] or date a [bunch of;girls], that kind of stuff doesn't [make me;feel good]. Plus it seems like most girls get a [ton of;messages] from the desperate loosers on here that no one even cares about reading a profile about someone they actually want to meet.

What I'm looking for is [someone that;wants to take a risk] and try and get to know someone for who they are. These dating sites are just around to make people money. These are just words and photographs. The lucky few on this site that are [looking for real;connections] can certainly contact me anytime, [I'd love to;hear from you].
