[I have never;owned a goat]. I have [absolutely no;interest in them]. Quite frankly they bore me.

Nice n' Spicyy Nik Naks are my third favourite crisps.

My Favourite books include [A History Of;Goats] by Penn & Teller (so fascinating), [Cooking with;Gypsies'] by Keith Floyd & the entire Callum Best mystery series.

My Favourite Movies include Withnail and Me, Jurrasic Island & Jeremy Guire. ([I've seen;them] so many times! [I know;them word for word]!) Another guilty pleasure of mine is Robocock Vs The Cyber Sluts ([I cry;every time]!)

The music I like [tends to;be really underground and alternative]. I like bands you probably haven't even heard of yet. Let us say [no more;about it]. I am [cooler than;you].

I don't [actually like;food]. I sustain myself by digesting [a mixture of;flour], water and grass. I sometimes put a cherry on top [but it's;purely ornamental] and I eat round it and pop it back in the jar afterwards.

I spend a disproportionate amount of my time [thinking about;the video for Put Yourself In My Place by Kylie Minogue]. Specifically the fact that while [floating in;the spacecraft] the left sleeve of her spacesuit is removed twice. [I find;it quite upsetting]. I'm also massively [addicted to;drugs] so [I tend to;think about scoring my next hit of delicious, delicious drugs].

My hobbies include drinking****ails and [making websites;censor perfectly acceptable words]
