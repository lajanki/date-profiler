I am an easy going sort of lad [who does not;take himself seriously], [can be;quiet] but once you get to know me [I never;shut up] lol. Thoughtful, respectful reliable, and honesty are [a few of my;good points] people would say.

[I work as;a chef], been in the trade for fifteen years, so cooking would be [another good;point of mine]. [Outside the;kitchen] [I like to;hang] with friends and family. In between that I go to the gym also a keen runner or [anything that;gets me a sweat on]. Football is a big passion, avid Newcastle United supporter.

The [music that;fuels my life] is dance and indie don't mind a bit of chart stuff depending what it is. I like to think of myself as unique because, hey, arent we all and thats [what makes;this life worth living].

Anything else you want to know just [drop me;a message] and [we will;take it] from there.

Hope to hear from you soon.
