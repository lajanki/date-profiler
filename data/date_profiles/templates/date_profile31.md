Five [things I couldn’t;live without]: My passport, my iPhone, my best friend, my scrapbook and... tequila.

My friends describe me as: Easy-going, passionate, [creative and;spontaneous]

The three things I’m most thankful for:

1. Having been fortunate enough to visit 59 countries (and counting!)
2. [My awesome;friends]
3. A great job that allows me to [live the life;I want] and have fun!

More about me: Hello gents – [thanks for;stopping by]. I’m a creative, fun-loving, energetic and active gal whose favourite words – in any language – are, “[Please proceed to;your gate for departure]”. [I’ve been bitten;HARD by the travel bug] and have been lucky enough to [visit every;continent] (well... [I’m working on;Antarctica]!) I love going out, meeting new people and generally [getting the most;out of life] – whether that’s trying new bars and restaurants or [picking up a new;sport] (I once joined in a game of pickup basketball with a group of kids in Zimbabwe – [it was;wicked]!) You should shoot me a message [if you are;fun-loving], fit, and up for anything – I am!

The most important thing I am [looking for in a;person]: I’m definitely looking for [someone who is;in love with life] and [open to;exploring all its possibilities]. [Travel is;a really big part of my life] and I’d love to meet [someone who wants to;join me on my many adventures]. I’d definitely like [to start a;family] one day, so I’m looking for a guy who’d also like [to raise a;couple of beautiful, multilingual, adventurous kids]!
