I'm a person [who enjoys;meeting new people] all the time. I love to socialize, embrace life and [am a lot;of fun] if I say so myself! [Online dating has;been quite the adventure] and I am [still looking for;that special someone]. If you are [looking for someone;genuine], [I'm your;man]! I don't have [patience for;people who pretend to be something they are not].

I'm honest, forgiving and [love to;laugh]. If you can [make me;laugh], I would be interested in [speaking to;you]. There are too many people who [take life;seriously] and don't make [time to;enjoy the finest pleasures]. That would include [taking in the;outdoors], [sitting in;front of a fireplace] and eating gummy worms on a regular basis for me!

Tell me what [your idea of;having fun] is. I enjoy the weekends out when [I am not;working in the week] and would love to [have someone;accompany me]. It could be [an evening of;taking in the local comedy scene] or local bands. [Drop me;an email] [and we'll;chat soon]!
