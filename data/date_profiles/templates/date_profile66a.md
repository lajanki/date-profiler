Although what I basically do for a living is [design software for;people/companies], I'm a hopeless romantic and very [unapologetic about;it]! A sizable portion of my salary is spent in buying ingredients since [I love;cooking], and [buying;paintings]! I generally spend my weekends playing [soccer with;my friends], or watching soccer matches (with/without them), [visiting;art galleries ]and [hunting for;more paintings to buy], and trying new dishes. On weekends I volunteer at the local animal shelter.

#### Qualities I Possess
I'm a hopeless romantic, pretty nocturnal ([sometimes it's;work, mostly it's movies, music, and soccer matches]), sporty, dependable (so I hear), very much the gentleman and old school when it comes to women (this I say so myself!), [not easily;ruffled], sensitive ([I feel guilty if;I kill a fly by mistake]), and generally happy with life.

#### Things I Love
Art, especially paintings. Umm, and paintings! I love to cook ([I make a;mean porchetta]!), [play and follow;soccer], practical jokes, weekends, starry nights, Bellini, Simbari, Ib Eisner, When Harry Met Sally, Green Street Hooligans, and many more. But I think these are [enough to;give you a fair idea about my interests].

#### You Are...
Someone who is [romantic, but;also practical] (so that we complement each other), who is generally happy and [doesn't get;worked up too easily], who loves eating (specially Italian food, for obvious reasons!), is optimistic, and [enjoys the;fine things in life (music, food, and art being the main ones)]. Also, you have a sense of humor and love practical jokes!
