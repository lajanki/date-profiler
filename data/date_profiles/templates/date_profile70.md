Life it [too short to;not be out having fun]. You will almost never find me home [sitting on my;couch] and watching TV on a Friday night. [I like to go;out ]and go dancing and I also love to [eat at the;best restaurants in town]. My friends like to say that [I am always;the life of the party] and with me, there is never a dull moment.

For me, the perfect partner can [enjoy having;a drink] with me at the end of the night and when we [feel like going;out for the night], [we can go;dancing]. I have never been one to [shy away from the;crowd] and I love to sing karaoke, especially when it’s a fun duet. My favorite karaoke song to sing is Don’t Stop Believing by Journey. [I’ve known all;the words to that song] [since I was;seven years old].

[I can show you;a good time] and while I like to have fun, I am definitely [ready to;settle down] and [find the right;person]. And while you are [more than welcome to;try and tame me], [I hope you will;be attracted to my outgoing and lively personality].
