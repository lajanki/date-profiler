Me:

- Sarcastic, sophisticated, witty, dorky, [sensitive and;free-spirited]. [Also a;fan of adjectives].
- A wizard [in the;kitchen]. Gordon Ramsey once told me that [I was;his idol]... Ok, maybe not, but I'm sure he'd [love the;flavor of my home-made gnocci].
- Nomadic Adventurer. I've [set foot on;5 continents] and have a [thirst for;exploring more]. I hope to one day go vacationing on Mars as I've heard the [mountains are;glorious].
- [Full of;random] (and oftentimes useless) information. I will [kick your;butt] at Trivial Pursuit.

You:

- Intelligent, sweet, down-to-earth and adventurous. Bonus points if [you're a little;bit quirky].
- An ambitious go-getter. I'm attracted to [people who;set big goals] and put all their [effort into;pursuing them]. Even if your life's dream is [to become;the world's greatest thumbwrestler], [I totally;dig it].
- A non-smoker... or at least [trying to;quit]. As open-minded as I am, [I have to draw;the line at cigarettes]. I can't stand their smell and [don't want to;be around smoke] all the time.
- Pet-friendly. My cat Felix [loves to;meet new people], but if you're [allergic to;fur], the two of you probably won't [get;along]. :(

[Me +;You]:

- An undeniably awesome [couple with;amazing chemistry]. [Let's make;the world jealous]!
