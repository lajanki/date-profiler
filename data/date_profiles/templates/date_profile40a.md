I know the first thing you're going to do is to [look at my;photos]! Go ahead, wait... I'm guessing if you've read this far [it means;I've passed the photo test]. [I was born in;Connecticut] and moved to [New York after;college]. I eventually [ended up on;the west coast] and after a seven year stint in LA I decided to move back. I loved my time in CA, especially Santa Barbara and Santa Inez. I returned to NYC two years ago and haven't looked back. [I'm super;happy] to be here. 

I'm just as comfortable playing bocce in some random Brooklyn bar as I would be [attending a;charity event] in Manhattan or a [baseball game in;Queens]. [As long as I'm;surrounded by good people], I always find [a way to;have fun]. 

Seriously, [I could go;on and on] about my virtues and vices, likes and dislikes, but [I've decided to;throw caution to the wind] and just put it out there just [looking to find;that smart and funny woman] to spend some amazing time with.
