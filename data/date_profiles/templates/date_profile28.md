* with ease [fit into my;arms] and rest her cheek on my chest
* may take hours [to get;dressed] but in the end it makes it all worthwhile, [when my face;lights up at the picture of you]
* The way u [fish for;compliments] even though we both know that [I think you;are the most beautiful and sexy woman in the world]
* Your choice of sexy stiletto strapped sandals and leather boots, and the fact that U actually wear them, simply because U know [I like it when;u wear them], [even though your;feet kills u after a while]. But [you know I`ll;massage them for you] afterwards
* How cute i think u are when we argue and u dig your heels in [to make a;point] and be heard
* The way your hand always finds mine when u are [vulnerable or;insecure]
* The way U smile and feel when U see [my name on;your mobile] unexpectedly
* The way u sit with your [legs sometimes;crossed] or tucked in under u, in a sexy way, or twine a leg through mine in a public place
* [The way that;u kiss me] when I least expect it
* The way u fit/fall into my arms when u wanna cuddle or cry or when u are [tired or;sad]
* Then the way u [apologize for;crying over something silly]..
