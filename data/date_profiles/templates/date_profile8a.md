[I just turned;31 years old]. [Although I;was born in Kansas], I now live in [the northern;states]. I have lived and traveled to many different places. [I love the;outdoors]. My [hobbies include;bird watching], bicycling, and really [anything that;involves a sailboat]. Sailing and classical music play a huge part [in my;life]. [I have a;parrot] named Edgers.

[I have been;in the travel business] all my life. I'm looking forward to having [more time to;travel] and [enjoy the;important things in life]. There are so many places to see and [things to;do]! I really love [learning about;different cultures] and [ways of;life].

I'm unique in that [I will not;waste time with shallow interactions]. I'm only open to meaningful, honest, and exclusive [relationships with;like minded people]. I'm not concerned with [having tons of;friends]. [A few good;friends] is all I need. I know it's [hard to;get to know someone] by just a few photos and a couple of paragraphs, so [if you want to;get to know me better] [you should;message me].
