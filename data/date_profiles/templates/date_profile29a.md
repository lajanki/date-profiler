The one thing I am most passionate about: [taking care of;others], helping people, and [making people;smile]. Yes – I know [that sounds;cheesy] – but I try [really hard to;brighten the day of everyone I meet], even if that’s just by asking a cashier [how they;are] or holding the door open for someone. I try to always think of that quote by the Dalai Lama: “[Be kind;whenever possible]. [It is always;possible].”

The [most influential person;in my life has been]: My grandfather. He lived until his 90s and was [beloved by;everyone he met].  [He gave me;my curious nature] and [taught me to;always think of others first]. He and my grandmother were married [for over;60 years] until he died, and he always said [she was the most;precious and important part of his life]. The way he treated her – with respect, kindness and gratitude – has really shaped the way I conduct myself [in all my;relationships] – particularly with women.

My friends describe me as: warm, generous, thoughtful and caring.

The one thing I wish people would notice more about me: [I can be;forthright] and direct [when I need to;be]. Not in a bar-fight kind of way, but I do know [how to get;what I want].

I am looking for: I love intimacy and [getting swept;up in a new relationship] – that whirlwind when you meet someone and fall for them instantly. I think true romance is about getting to know someone and [connecting on;a deep level] – it’s more than just [chemistry and;attraction].
