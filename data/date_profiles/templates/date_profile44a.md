[Hello to;everyone reading this]! [I'm new to;the online dating scene] and have heard good and [bad things about;it]. I never assume anything before [finding out;all the facts] on my own. I am newly single and [want to move;slowly back into dating]. [If you are;someone who likes to take things slow] and [use their;slow cooker], send me a message!

My adventurous side has me watching anything on storm watching and would love to try it with someone [who knows what;they are doing]. It's always great [to learn;new things] and have a [list of things;I'd like to accomplish by the end of the year]. It would be nice to meet someone [who wants to;learn new hobbies and interests from each other]. I am a [chef by;profession] and artist by the weekend. I am a self-taught artist who enjoys [dabbling in;paint], [ceramics and;anything unusual].

If [you are a;risk-taker] and would like to know more, I would enjoy [receiving a message;from you]. [Tell me what;you find risky]. Have a creative week and [watch out for;that storm]!
