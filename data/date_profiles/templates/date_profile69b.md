As an individual [who is in;love with the world], I am [someone who always;tries to see the best in people]. I am definitely an idealist [who is always;trying to help make the world a better place]. Ideally, [you think;the same way as I do].

I love traveling the world and helping [those who are;in need]. My favorite time was when my school traveled to Guatemala to [help build a;school] in a small village. In my spare time [I work in a;soup kitchen] and [volunteer at;an animal shelter]. [The cats are;my favorite] and if I could, I would take them all [home with;me].

My perfect date involves hiking and bringing along a picnic. Letâ€™s team up together, get to know each other, and then work on [saving the;world] little by little.
