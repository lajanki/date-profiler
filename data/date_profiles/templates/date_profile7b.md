[Born and Raised in;Boston] but reside here in Duketown. [I'm very;family oriented], and love sports (but then again what guy doesn't). [I love to;go sky diving] and spend time [hanging out;with friends]. I'm an easy going person and try to [stay clear of;any drama].

[My dreams;are to flourish in my career] and eventually [own my own;business] one day. In the mean time I enjoy [working in the;medical industry] and am [lucky to have a;job] [considering the;economy these days].

My favorite music consist of smooth jazz, alternative pop, and 80's stadium rock. However I'm open to listening to anything original. [I'm a music;junkie] so I [don't mind;other genre's]. [In my;free time] [I enjoy;walking the dog], [getting drawn;into a good book], and most of all [staring at the;night sky] and wondering the [mysteries of;the universe]. 

I [don't smoke but;will have the occasional Cigar] depending on the event/occasion.

I'm looking for a [woman I can;vibe with] on a spiritual and intellectual level. Someone [who can;teach me new things] and inspire me.

Interested? [Send me a;message] and we can [go from;there].
