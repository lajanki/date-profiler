I think every morning should [begin with;strong coffee] (triple shot of espresso, please!) and every evening should end with snuggling, cozy blankets, and [maybe a;Netflix episode] or two.

I feel proud of myself [when I finish;a big, challenging project], particularly creative projects. I feel [annoyed at;myself] when I say "Yes!" to too many commitments and over-schedule myself ([but I'm;working on that.])

If you were to [peek inside;my fridge] right now, you would find iced coffee, milk, caramel, several [types of;cheese], prosciutto, grapes, random mustards, salad fixings, and [leftovers from;last night's Thai takeout].

[I feel;calm] when I’m [hiking in;the middle of the forest] (I [try to;get out there] at least once a month). I feel scared when I’m a passenger in a car and the [driver is;going too fast and aggressively] (please don't).

My [number one;goal], right now, is to [finish writing;my next book] — [ask me about;it] on our first date and [I’ll;share more]. :)

I’ve been told that [I have;very beautiful eyes (greenish-blue)] and also, [I give;pretty epic hugs].

My favorite thing about [being in;a relationship] is that moment when you both [realize that;staying in] and just being together on a Saturday night is the most fun plan [that you can;imagine].

[If we go;on a date], you can expect lots of questions (like, "[What's the best;birthday cake you've ever eaten]?") because [I tend to;ask a lot of questions] when I feel nerv-cited (nervous + excited).

[If you write;to me], I [want to know;what was the best part of your day], so far?
