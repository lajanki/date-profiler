Who am I? I’m Spider-Man. Wait, no, [that was a;movie]! I would [describe myself as;stable in my career] and goal-oriented.

[I enjoy;making people laugh]. I am intelligent and can carry on meaningful conversations. I care about [other people’s;feelings]. [When I’m;with someone special] [I like being;spontaneous], adventurous, romantic, surprising them [with little;gestures], sensual, playful, and basically [having that type;of fun you see two people who just met in the movies having]! Someone to laugh with, hang out with, be spontaneous with, and have fun with!

I’m looking for [someone who has;similar qualities] and desires [someone who;they can connect with]. I feel [there has to be;mutual physical attraction] for there to be good chemistry between two people. So being fit and [having good;looks] are important, as well as sensuality and affection. [Having some;similar interests] helps–some things I enjoy are fine dining, walking at the beach at night, going dancing, watching movies including foreign films, travelling, going snowboarding, going on day trips to local attractions, [having romantic;nights at home], cuddling, and basically [having a;blast] together.
