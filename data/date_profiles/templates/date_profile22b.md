About me, oh no [this is;the worst bit]!? Well my friends in a recent poll said that [I am;relaxed] and easy-going, I know how to [make them;smile] and cheer them up which [must be a;good thing]. [I am also;loyal], honest and gregarious.

In my spare time I enjoy [looking after;myself], [going to;the gym], cycling, [spending time with;my friends and family] and of course [a few;beers] at the weekend!

I enjoy life as you never know [what is;around the corner], I love doing random things including weekends away exploring and [visiting new;places], and of course [we all;have a good holiday] in the sun in our repertoire of enjoyment! I enjoy [going to see;live music], [seeing a;good comedian], cinema, watching Newcastle United and eating out to name a few.

[I have been;single] for a few years now, not because [I am a;weirdo] but I do not seem to have found that amazing girl who just [makes life;fall into place], I would like to settle down [with the right;person], [are you;out there]? I would however rather stay as a happy singleton than [part of an;unhapppy couple].

I am not interested in crazy women [who want to;get married tomorrow], Rome was not built in a day! [I have a good;job] (I am a driller, think Armageddon not DIY SOS!). I have got [a full head;of hair], my own teeth, and [my own;car].

The rest is for you to find out of course so if you sound of similar mind and enjoy some of the things that I do [why not get;in touch]?
