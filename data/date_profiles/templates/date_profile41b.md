I am convinced that [your favorite;Sesame Street character] tells [a lot about;your personality]. [I am in the;corporate world] but have hippie sensibilities. I remember my "pleases" and "thank yous" and [never take;anyone for granted]. I am spontaneous [even when;I plan to be]. [If I'm;feeling lucky], I'll split two 8's against a 9. [I've been called;a walking Shazaam (the music service...I can't grant wishes)]. I prefer coffee ice cream to coffee and darts to pool. I'm always up for [a good;opera]... it's the only chance I get to nap. 

In the past 18 months, [I have run;two marathons] and six half marathons, summitted two mountains over 13.3k feet an another over 14.4k feet (Mount Rainier), bungee-jumped, spelunked, and sky-dived, [traveled to;new] and favorite places (Nicaragua, Honduras, France, Switzerland, Morocco and Israel), and [snowboarded in;Colorado], Utah and Mont Tremblant. In other words, I [like to be;on the move]. I keep [hearing from;girlfriends] that men in NYC are intimidated by smart, successful women. That's absurd. I'm not. [If you fit;that description], write me. [Let's make;it happen].
