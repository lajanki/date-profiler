Good Humored, still pretty new to NYC... moved here in September, and while I can honestly [say that I;love it], I know that [there is so much;more to experience]. [I still get;the chills] [when someone asks;me my address] and I finish it off [by saying,;New York, NY]. 

I mostly define [myself as a;runner], and if you're a runner too, [you know what;that means]! I've run seven marathons with a few more up my sleeve. I love most sports and often spend my weekends [watching a;healthy dose of football]. I'm easy to spot... I'll be the one singing Bear Down. I still hold onto my childhood [dreams of catching;a ball] at a baseball game. 

On a less serious note, I can [often be found;dancing around my living room]. Please note that I make no promises [about my;dancing skills], but [I certainly;have a good time]. :)
