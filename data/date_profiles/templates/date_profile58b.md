About Me: I’m 36. [I have been a;runaway bride] twice now. I’m just not cut out for this ‘[until death;do us part thing]’. How about we do ‘[until we both;get on each others nerves], stop sleeping together and are [plotting our;escapes].’ [That may sound;bad], but [how many people;do you know that are happily married]? [I don’t know;very many that are happily married]. I am definitely a believer in [being faithful to;one another] and I love [the thought of;sharing a home]. [As long as;you’re not bossy or rude], we will get along just fine. Just [don’t ask me to;marry you]. Okay? Okay.

We can live our lives happily without that stressful commitment. [I’m definitely not a;commitment phobe]. I just [don’t believe in a;silly piece of paper]. So if you think you are a perfect match for me [go ahead and;send me a message]. [I’m still;single] and [ready to;mingle].
