A friend told me that online [dating sites are;frequented by some very strange people], so I figured [I should;filter out a few folks by asking some serious questions]. Please answer carefully: 

1. [Are you a;fan of Justin Bieber]?
1. Have you watched more than 2 episodes of Jersey Shore? 

If your answers to both questions was 'no', then congratulations, [you've passed;the first test]! [If you;answered 'yes' to either questions], then I'm afraid there's [no way;we'll get along], sorry! 

[Now that we've;gotten the formalities out of the way], [let me;introduce myself]... I am a second-year college student, [hoping to;major in art history]. Renaissance-era paintings make my heart glow and I would love to one day [share my;passion] with others by [becoming an;art professor]. 

On a typical Friday night [I am probably;attending yoga class], or biking down one of the many gorgeous trails in our city. I'm the type of person who will [do things;on a whim], and I'm looking for a [partner with;the same mentality]. 

I make [an effort to;eat raw foods] as much as possible, [but I've been;known to indulge in a Big Mac] on occasion. (I must admit, there's no better [cure for;a hangover] than two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun!) 

Anyway, [if you're;a laid-back intellectual] who can appreciate a freshly made quinoa salad and [the occasional;chai latte], [send me a;message].
