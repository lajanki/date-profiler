On a Saturday night, you can usually find me [curled up on;the couch] [watching my;favorite TV show]. [Instead of going;to a bar or concert], my idea of fun is hanging out at home by myself or with [my closest;friends]. My ideal date involves me cooking dinner, [playing some;Scrabble], and watching a classic movie.

While I am a bit of a homebody, [I like going;out] too. Quiet [walks in;the park] are my jam and I like to hang out in my favorite bookstore. The library and my neighborhood coffee shop are some of my other [favorite places to;hang out].

When I first meet someone, [I can be a little;bit shy], but I come out of my shell right away [when it is;the right person]. If I am quiet for the first time, it is because [I am being;observant] and [taking everything;in]. My friends would say that my best attributes are that I am a loyal and thoughtful person.
