I tie my own shoes, [brush my;own hair], and make my own bed... (well, only if my [mom isn't;at home].)

During the day, [I can be;found sitting in an office cubicle], feverishing tapping my phone with hopes of [getting a;new high score on Candy Crush]. I like to spend my evenings [watching re-runs of;Felecity] while [sipping on;a glass of Chardonnay]. I play a mean [game of;rock-paper-scissors] (was the national champion for 2 years straight), and love the [smell of;pop tarts] in the morning (part of a complete breakfast!)

On our first date, I'll [fly you to;Paris] on my private jet, where [we'll watch;Celine Dion perform live in concert]. After the show, I'll [whisk you;away to a private beach resort] in St. Tropez, just in time to watch the sun set [over the;glistening water]. Or if [that doesn't;excite you], we could [just grab;coffee] at the Starbucks on 24 ave.

You should message me if [you are;Smart], Sexy, Sophisticated, Sassy and Spontaneous. (Bonus points [if you;have over eight years of experience as a forklift operator].)
