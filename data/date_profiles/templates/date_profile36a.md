I'm more of an indoor guy than an outdoor one, although I do [love my;morning jogs and evening walks]. I prefer partying at home with some wine and a good book than [be out;clubbing/dancing]. Also, [I am pretty much;an introvert], but I do love hanging out occasionally [with my;closest friends].

### On My Good Days:

I am a pretty interesting person to be around if you appreciate [trivia about;anything and everything in the universe] (like, an albatross can [fly while;it is sleeping]!), quite goofy, usually pottering around [in my;small garden], [trying to fix;things up], figure out logical answers to [questions like;"Will the universe start compressing once it reaches its limit?"], or lying on the sofa with Kim watching TV and [eating;garlic bread].

### On My Off Days:

I just like to sit quietly in my room with [a copy of;Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy] and a glass of wine, or flip [channels on;TV]. I am pretty quiet on my off days and [prefer to be;left to my own devices]. But [these days are;rare].

### Things I Love/I'm Interested in:

- [My pet;cat], Kim.
- [Gardening;].
- Astronomy.
- [Cheesecakes;].
- Wine.
- [Collecting;trivia].
- [Discovering new;things].
- [Asking;questions].
- [Learning new;languages]. ([I'm currently;conquering] Spanish! And I already know English, Marathi, French and Hindi.)

### What I'm Looking For:
Someone who is interested in [science and;astronomy], who is [cheerful and;optimistic], and generally a quiet person [who can;have conversations] but does not consider talking the sole purpose of life, [who is also;curious about things], has a love of languages, and [who has;a sense of individuality].
