[A little about;myself]...

[I am a very;hard working dedicated person] [and I live;life to it’s fullest]. [I laugh often;]and am very optimistic. I think [my smile is;contagious] :) I have young children, ages 8 and 11, that I simply love. My 11 year old is soooo smart that we are [able to have;intellectual conversations] (or does that mean I have the intellect of an 11 year old?). My 8 year old is fun too but is the [complete opposite of;the other].

I am a lifetime student and [I have 2;undergrad degrees], one graduate, and I’m [working on my;MBA] now. I tell myself [I will stop;after this one]. I guess I just like the challenge :)

In my free time I spend lots of time with my children (they don’t live with me, [but they live;very close by]), [play the;piano and drums], exercise daily, mountain bike, ride jet skis and 4 wheelers in the summer [and snowboard in;the winter]. I [always try to;keep busy doing something]. Oh and [I LOVE to;cook].

I enjoy helping others more than anything else. I would put everything I’m doing on hold if someone I know [needed help with;anything at all].

I love to travel (the Caribbean being my favorite) and while my immediate family all live here, I have family on the east coast, west coast, and in Southern France. I visit them all [as often as;possible].

[I am incredibly;honest] and trustworthy. I would expect my match to [have the same;qualities]. That is extremely important.

I have a great, maybe sarcastic, [sense of;humor] ([some would say;disturbing]). My humor is along the lines of Simpsons, Reno 911, Chevy Chase, Naked Gun, Seinfeld, stuff like that.
