Howdy, ma'am! My name's Clint, and I'm [here to;steal your heart] ([with your;permission], of course). Cheesy lines aside, I thought it would be [fun to;try out this online dating thing], as many of my [friends have;recommended it]. Apparently, [you can;meet some pretty cool people online] (who would've thunk?!). So without further ado, [here are;a few tidbits about myself]... 

I [spend my days;working as a Social Media director] at a nationwide travel agency. In a nutshell, [this means;I get to fly across the country and make posts about our company on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook]. The [traveling is;exciting], however the nature of my job has sorta, kinda [turned me into;an internet addict]. 9 times out of 10, when I enter an unfamiliar building, the first thought that comes to my mind is: "[Does this;place have wi-fi]?". Fortunately, I find [time to play;baseball] twice a week, which [keeps me from;turning into a potato]. 

My biggest passion in life is music. I LOVE Bon Jovi, Journey and Van Halen (and pretty much [every other;hair band] from the 80's!). There's nothing quite as exhilarating as strumming on a six-string [with my;friends] as we sing classic rock songs at the top of our lungs. 

Family is very important to me, and I make it a point to have dinner with my folks at least twice a week. It has always been a dream of mine [to have a;large family] of my own one day - [the more;kids] the merrier. 

Five things I couldn't do without: 

- [The Internet;] 
- My Guitar 
- My Dog Rex 
- [The New York;Giants] 
- [Nutella;] 

3 random [facts about;me]: 

1. I learned [how to;juggle chainsaws] from my neighbour [who used to;be a clown] in the traveling circus. This may not seem a particularly useful skill, although I'm confident it will come in handy at some point in the future. 
1. [I once ate;34 chicken McNuggets] in one sitting after being dared by a friend. Needless to say, [I wasn't;very active] for the remainder of the day. 
1. [My mom;is a massive Barry Manilow fan]. This resulted in me subconsciously [learning the;lyrics to every song on his Tryin' to Get the Feeling album] by age 8. 

Anyway, if you're not [allergic to;musicians] or a clever [sense of;humor], feel [free to;send me a message]!
