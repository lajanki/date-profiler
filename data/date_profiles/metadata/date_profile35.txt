and I enjoy;moonlight strolls on the beach
dancing to;European beats
my friends would describe me as;easy going
describe me as;easy going
spending your;Sunday mornings and Monday nights
you should definitely;message me
so you must love;golden labs
thing you should;know
should have a;sense of humor
laugh at my;corny jokes
and be;understanding
just want to;be in a relationship with my best friend
I really just;want to be in a relationship
in a relationship with;my best friend
going out to a;rowdy pub for a trivia night
spending a;Saturday night curled up on the couch watching a good movie
watching a;good movie
My name is;Susan
yelling obscenities at;the television
