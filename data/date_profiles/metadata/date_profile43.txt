Weird things happen;to me
if we;get together
you're in for;a wild ride
broken down;in front of dozens of honking customers
people in the;film industry
I'd rather be;making my own headlines as a writer
making my own;headlines as a writer
to write;comedy
they are my;anchor
staying up;late
always sleep;in
I definitely have;an adventurous streak
trying out an;exotic recipe
My idea of;a first date
first date is;simple really
into my;arms
before you;faint
over my;shoulder
to my;Ferrari
left as;fantasies
the perfect;relationship
provide the;base
My ultimate goal is to;move to LA to write comedy
from Paris to;Venice
relaxing on;some remote Greek island
