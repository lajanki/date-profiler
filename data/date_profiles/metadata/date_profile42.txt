to be a;doctor
geekier than;my cool friends
my geeky;friends
I tend to;stand out
to get more;customers
It's going;very, very well
I'm very;laid back
easy to;get along with
who make my;life all that much better
some who;probably wouldn't talk to you
I learned to;play guitar
if you can;sing off tune to my out of tune guitar
to my;out of tune guitar
brought me;a lot of confidence
a lot of;confidence
better than the;old version of me
old version of;me
give you;triple points
But don't;worry
way cooler than;my geeky friends
I'm currently;helping businesses design websites to get more customers
to play;guitar
I don't think;I'm better than you
better than;you
