in love with the;world
someone who always;tries to see the best in people
the best in;people
always trying to;help make the world a better place
trying to;help make the world a better place
make the world;a better place
you think;the same way as I do
helping those who;are in need
who are in;need
help build a;school
In my spare time I;work in a soup kitchen
cats are my;favorite
I would take;them all home with me
