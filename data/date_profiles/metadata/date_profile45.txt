writing about what;a great catch I am
I've always believed;that actions speak louder than words
face to face for;coffee
I have;flaws
I'm not scared to;let you know that I have flaws
can use a;whole package of good paper trying to handwrite something
trying to;handwrite something
handwritten letter to;family and friends
recycling is;huge
because I'm a;perfectionist
have the perfect;job
classes at;the University
I'm still;looking for my true calling
looking to;meet someone for casual dating
meet someone for;casual dating
make sure to;email me
looking to;date
tell me something about;yourself
