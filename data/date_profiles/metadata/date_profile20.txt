who does not;take himself seriously
can be;quiet
I never;shut up
another good;point of mine
Outside the;kitchen
I like to;hang
anything that;gets me a sweat on
music that;fuels my life
gets me;a sweat on
what makes;this life worth living
drop me;a message
we will;take it
a few of my;good points
I work as;a chef
