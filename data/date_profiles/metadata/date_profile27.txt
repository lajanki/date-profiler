At least I’m;honest
If this is what;you want
need a good;friend
If you want to;laugh
simply have a;good friend
not looking for;sex
because I’m;destitute
I’m not;here because
to find a;wife
no need for;another
They’ve got;a mother
deal with my;baggage
I’m better than;others
I don’t need;welfare cases
I’m an;“old man”
I can’t;spell
I’m too;old
I'll show you;what real lust and love is
camp in;the bush
comfortable with;myself beeing sensitive
I’m in touch with;my feminine side
Just because I;drive nice cars and convertibles
I’m actually;peaceful and laid back
I’m full of;s*t
if you can;look past my big ears
with me you;can get it all
you can get;it all
I'm wearing a;pink shirt
I'm wearing a pink shirt;and pink undies
