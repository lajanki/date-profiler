too short to;not be out having fun
sitting on my;couch
I like to go;out 
eat at the;best restaurants in town
I am always;the life of the party
enjoy having;a drink
feel like going;out for the night
we can go;dancing
shy away from the;crowd
Iâ€™ve known all;the words to that song
since I was;seven years old
I can show you;a good time
ready to;settle down
ready to;settle down and find the right person
find the right;person
more than welcome to;try and tame me
I hope you will;be attracted to my outgoing and lively personality
you will be;attracted to my outgoing and lively personality
