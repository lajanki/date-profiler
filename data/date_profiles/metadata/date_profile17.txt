dating sites are;frequented by some very strange people
I should;filter out a few folks by asking some serious questions
some serious;questions
Are you a;fan of Justin Bieber
you've passed;the first test
If you;answered 'yes' to either questions
no way;we'll get along
Now that we've;gotten the formalities out of the way
let me;introduce myself
hoping to;major in art history
share my;passion
becoming an;art professor
I am probably;attending yoga class
do things;on a whim
partner with;the same mentality
an effort to;eat raw foods
but I've been;known to indulge in a Big Mac
cure for;a hangover
if you're;a laid-back intellectual
fan of;Justin Bieber
I'm afraid;there's no way we'll get along
there's no;better cure for a hangover than two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun
the occasional;chai latte
send me a;message
