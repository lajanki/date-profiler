I like my;artsy with a little bit of fartsy
drinking massive amounts of;coffee
lingering over;newspapers
I read;comics
you’ll just have to;wait and see
What can I say;
I love that damn;mouse
I love that;damn mouse
a thing for;cowboys
when I was;11
in my;basement
My parents let me;keep that thing up
and it was;magic
I don’t know what;y’all are thinking
