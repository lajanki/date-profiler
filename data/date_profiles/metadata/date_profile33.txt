and I live;life to itâ€™s fullest
I am a very;hard working dedicated person
I laugh often;
my smile is;contagious
able to have;intellectual conversations
complete opposite of;the other
working on my;MBA
I tell myself;I will stop after this one
I will stop;after this one
but they live;very close by
and snowboard in;the winter
always try to;keep busy doing something
if someone;I know needed help with anything at all
needed help with;anything at all
I am incredibly;honest
have the same;qualities
sense of;humor
some would say;disturbing
A little about;myself
I have 2;undergrad degrees
play the;piano and drums
I LOVE to;cook
as often as;possible
