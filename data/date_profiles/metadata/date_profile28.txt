fit into my;arms
in the end it;makes it all worthwhile
the most;beautiful
I like it when;u wear them
when we;argue
when u are;vulnerable
when I;least expect it
when u wanna;cuddle or cry
when u are;tired or sad
when we are;apart
When u say;“I love you”
can handle;most of that
find the right;spot on my shoulder
the picture of;you
picture of;you
you know I`ll;massage them for you
my name on;your mobile
in a public;place
apologize for;crying over something silly
your eyes tell;me so
