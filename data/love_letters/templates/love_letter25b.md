# Sorry We Didn't Agree

It looks like [I have done;it again]--[I upset;our relationship] and [accused you of;fooling around]. I don't know why I get so crazy when you [talk about your;co-workers], but I do. I try to [control my;anger], but it goes out of control without my even [thinking about what;I am doing or saying].

You tell me that these are [people you;have to work with], and that you are [only being;pleasant], but it seems that [you enjoy;these other people] too much; I know that is [not a fair;assessment], but that is the way it seems to me. [I guess I;am over-reacting], [and I am;sorry].

No matter what, [I still love;you], and [I want to;be with you]. Please call so that we can talk and [get on;the right track].
