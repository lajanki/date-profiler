# A Little Secret

[After being;your best friend] and telling you [all my hopes;and desires], I need to tell you [what will;make me happy].

[You have always been;there for me] [through our;ups and downs]; you've listened to my problems and, most of all, you've put up with me and [all the crazy;things I do]. [I love being;with you] and [acting like;fools], and I just love [everything about;you].

[You are the;best friend I have ever had], but last night when I was [trying to;go to sleep], I kept [thinking about all;the other boys]. [But then I;thought about you], [and I couldn't;stop thinking about you!] I thought about all the good times we've had together, and I thought about [that day we;went mudding on the four wheelers], and I realized that it's not the other [people I want to;be with], it's you. I love you and [I want to be;with you], [forever and;a day].
