# Tell Me What I Did Wrong

[I can tell;that you're upset with me]. [You haven't;called me in three days], and [when I've tried to;call you], you've had little to say and want to hang up quickly. I've thought about it and I [can't figure out;what I did to turn you against me]. Did I do or say something wrong at the party last weekend? That's [the last time I;saw you]. When we said goodbye, [you didn't seem;upset], but maybe I was just [too tired;to] notice.

[If I did;do something], I'm really sorry. I can honestly say that I [didn't mean to;hurt you] or offend you in any way. [I love;you]. I [hate it when;you're unhappy with me]. [Could we please;meet] so you can tell me if I did [something that;bothered you]? If it's not me and something else is bothering you that you haven't told me about, [maybe we could;have dinner] and talk. [I want to get;everything out in the open] and come to [some kind of;an understanding]. If you're interested, [we could go to;a hockey game] afterwards and just have some fun.

[Please think;about it].
