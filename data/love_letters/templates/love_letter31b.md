# Tell Me What I Did Wrong

[How are things;going]? [I haven't seen;much of you lately]. I'm not sure, but [it seems like;you're upset with me]. You're not exactly out-and-out avoiding me, but every time I suggest doing something these days, [you have some;reason not to]. And [you haven't;called] for a few days. [You could just;be really busy], I guess, or maybe you have a lot on your mind with work or something else?

[If I've;done something to offend you or hurt you], I'm sorry--really. Jan told me yesterday that you had mentioned to her [I had a;phone conversation] with Dave the other day. I [don't know if;my talking to him might have upset you], but I hope not. I know [we haven't;known each other for very long], but [ever since;Jan introduced us], I've thoroughly enjoyed [spending time;together] and getting to know you. [The last;month and a half] has been a lot of fun because [I never know;what to expect] when I'm with you. You have a real [love for;life], and I truly admire your optimism and your [positive;attitude]. You're [such a good;person], so your friendship means a great deal to me. Please know that I would never [do anything to;intentionally cause you pain].

[Could we;get together and talk]? I'd really like to know [what's on;your mind these days]. Maybe we could go for a walk along the beach on Saturday ([I can;pack a picnic lunch]), or [we could go;to Taquito's] Friday night (my treat) and maybe catch a movie afterwards. [I know how;you love Mexican food].

[What do you;say]? I'll call on Thursday to see [how things are;going] and see if [we can get;together] one of those days.

Take care.
