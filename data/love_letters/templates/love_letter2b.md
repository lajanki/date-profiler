# A Reason For Living

I was sent down to earth on a mission, a mission to [find someone that;would complete me]. I never thought that [my task;would be fulfilled] till the very [moment that I;met you]. That's when I [finally found the;perfection] that I had been seeking all my life. At that very moment, [I didn't believe;my eyes] as the [girl that I had;thought only existed in a fairytale] was now [standing in;front of me]. Each night, as I stood [staring at;the moon], I saw [your gentle;smile], the smile that gave me [the strength to;make the impossible possible].

My [love for;you] grows each and every day. I am totally [addicted to;you], and you are the only drug that keeps me functioning now. When I [look into;your eyes], I see [the real;me], [a person that;lives for a goal and a purpose] now. I pray fervently each day that you and I can be in a relationship that will grow to be [more than;friends] some day. For now, I've written this letter to declare my [love for;you] and to tell you that I am here [waiting for;you now].
