# You're My Better Half, We Make Each Other Whole!

I was thinking about you today. I was thinking about [how well we;fit together], not just physically, but emotionally and spiritually as well. [I feel like we;are parts of a puzzle that fit together perfectly], and [we are only;whole] when we are together. [I thought I was;happy] before I met you, but now [I know what;true happiness is]. You have [changed my;life] for the better in so many ways.

[I never knew;that little things could mean so much]. [When I start to;fall asleep] on the couch, I love the way you [cover me with;a blanket]. You leave me little notes in the steam on the mirror [when you're done with;your shower] [and it's my;turn]. And [when you know;I've had a really hard day], [you always;suggest we go out to dinner].

[I like to do;little things] for you, too. [I don't even think;about it]; [I just want to;do something to make your day better]. [When you have to;work late], [I bring you;dinner]. Before you leave on a trip, [I always put;a love note] and a little surprise in your suitcase. And when you really get stressed, I rub your neck and listen as [you tell me all;about it].

The past three years have been like a dream. I promise I'll always be there for you and [I know you'll;always be there for me]. I love you. [I hope you know;that you mean the world to me]. I don't like to think about [what I would do if;I ever lost you], because [I know I'd;only be half the woman that I am today].
