# We Need To Separate For A While

Writing this letter makes me very sad. [I don't want to;hurt you], but I can't go on like this anymore. [We need to;end this relationship]. Maybe we could try again in the future [to make it;work], but I can't try anymore right now.

[Trying to improve;this relationship] is all I've focused on lately, and it has negatively impacted other areas of my life: my job, my friends, and my family. [I have been;stressed out] and [on edge with;everyone around me]. [I don't like;who I am] right now. I need to [focus on;getting back to where I feel happy and at peace with myself and my life].

[Things have;really worsened] [over the past;few months]. [It seems like;we don't talk at all anymore]. I don't think we trust each other [enough to;even try to talk]. We rarely spend any time together and when we do, [it feels;awkward and uncomfortable].

We've both done regrettable things to this relationship and to each other. It's time we admit to ourselves and to each other that [it's going to;be a lot healthier for both of us to just to separate]. [It hurts;me to tell you this] because I still [care about;you very deeply]. [We've had;some great times together] and I [hate to;leave those behind], but I think we'll be [better off;apart]. I will always [care about;you], and I will always remember the [early days of;our life together] with fondness.

Let's wait a couple of months and then reevaluate [how we;feel]. Maybe we can [try to make;our relationship work again], or maybe we'll discover by then that [our lives have;moved in separate directions] and [we can only;be friends].
