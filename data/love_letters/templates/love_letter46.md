# We Need To Slow Down

I really like you, but [we need to;slow down]. It feels like our relationship is moving so fast that I'm [no longer in;control] and [that's not a;feeling I'm comfortable with]. I've been in relationships before that have moved too fast and then crashed and burned. I [don't want;that to happen to us].

As I said, [I really do;like you] and [I enjoy the;time that we spend together], but I'm feeling [a lot of;stress]. I'm torn because I want to see [what happens to;our relationship], but things are happening so fast that [I'm starting to;get anxious] and worry about it.

[I don't want this;to be the end]; [I'd like to keep;seeing you], but I'm just [not ready to;commit myself only to you]. I would [love to see;you] once or twice a week, so we can [continue to get;to know each other] and let things happen naturally, but I'm just not ready to [get too;serious] right now. I hope that you can understand that and [we can still;see each other], but [not quite as;often].
