# I'd Like to Get to Know You Better

[I normally;avoid bowling]. Rolling a bowling ball into a gutter nine times out of ten is not [my idea for;fun]. But I'm glad Bill [invited me to;bowl] last Friday night--otherwise I [would not have;met you]. By the way, I'm the tall, uncoordinated guy [who was wearing;the striped socks] and couldn't manage to break 90--but [we had;fun], didn't we?

I hope you won't think [I am too;bold] by saying that [I really enjoyed;being with you]. I love your [sense of;humor] and how you immediately [made me feel;at ease]. I was also fascinated by your [knowledge of;the Napoleonic Wars]--a longtime interest of mine. I've often wanted to meet someone [who could;talk intelligently about that era of history]. I went home that Friday evening thinking that [you and I must;have many more common interests]--besides our [obsession with;bowling], I mean. Dinner, for example.

Over the last few days I have asked myself, "[I wonder if;she likes lobster or steak]? Does she prefer salad or rice? Does she fold her napkin diagonally or rectangularly?" These are [questions that;beg an answer]. And [I can think of;only one way to find out]. I propose that we get to the bottom of the "dinner" issue by my [inviting you to;Marie's Restaurant] this Saturday night. We could also resume our discussion about Napoleon--[there are at least;three more years] that we need to explore. Afterwards, I was thinking about [taking you to;see Oklahoma!]... unless you would [rather go;bowling].

[Please say;yes]! Bill gave me your cell number. I'll call you on Thursday. [I'd really like to;see you again].

[Until;then]!

P. S. I've assumed that [you are not;involved with anyone]. I hope not, because I think [we could have;an enjoyable evening together].
