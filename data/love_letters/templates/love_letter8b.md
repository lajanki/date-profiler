# I Love You

I sit here, [lost in;the memory of you]. [What is;today]? I don't know. What is it I'm supposed to be doing now? I can't remember. It couldn't have been very important. [Thoughts of;last night] still fill my mind and heart. [Nothing else seems;worth my time and effort]. Where am I? Well, not here in this confined space, not really. I'm still lost in everything I felt [when we were;together]. That was when you and [I became;"us"] and I [could no longer;tell where you left off and I began]. I love you, Lisa, and [my love is;lasting] and true. I'm [not sure when;it began] but [I know it;will never end]. Surely, life can offer no higher fulfillment than [what we;experienced last night].

[There can be no;other woman] in my life now but you. [I've been involved;in other relationships] in the past, but they certainly can't [compare to;what I have found with you] or to what I'm feeling now. Perhaps the others were just "dry runs," [practice for;the real thing], for a reality that I couldn't even imagine until I had experienced it for myself. Last night, I couldn't help but surrender to the [feelings that;had captured my soul] and yet [promised me;freedom and joy]. Today, the words of an old John Denver song come to mind, and it is only now that I understand what the "[sweet;surrender]" he sang about really means.

You must know [I can't stand;being away from you] much longer. [I hope you;feel the same way]. Lisa, [tell me when;can I see you again]!

I love you.
