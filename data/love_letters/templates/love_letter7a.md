# I Love You

Like the song says, last night was "[Just Like;Heaven]." [I'm sitting;here at work], thinking of you, and I can't even find the words that will [express the;way I'm feeling]. [I can tell you;this], though--after last night, I am 100% positive that [I'm in;love with you].

I love [everything about;you]... [I love your;blue eyes], your thick hair, [and your;smile]. I love [the sound of;your laugh] and of your voice, and [the warmth of;your body] [when you hold;me]. I love [the smell of;your cologne] and [the taste of;your lips]. I love how, [when you touch;me], tingles race up and down my spine. You arouse [all of my;senses].

I [don't want to;be with anyone else]; [I only want;to be with you]. I've never felt this way about anyone before. [I feel like I'm;floating], like my heart is skipping, like [my mouth will;never stop smiling]. [I love talking to;you]; I feel like [I could tell you;anything]. I love the way that you respect my opinions, [even when they;differ from your own]. I love the way that [I feel;special] whenever you're around. It feels like there's [no one else in;the room]. I love how you look [into my;eyes] and I feel like I can see into the [depths of your;soul].

[I love the;man that you are], and I [cannot wait to;see you again].
