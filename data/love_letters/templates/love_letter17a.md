# I'm Falling For You

I wish I could really express the happiness I have found in [spending time with;you] [over the last;few week]s. [Getting to know;you] has brought a dimension to my life that it just never had before. [Every time we;are together], [the world looks;a little better] and [the sun shines;a little brighter].

[I'm not;exaggerating] when I say that [you're the;kindest], most animated, and most amazing person I have ever met. [The more I learn about;you], the more [I want to;know]. [You're;incredible]! You have, in a way, [changed the;way I see the world]. [I am a;better person], and [I want to be;an even better person], just [because I have;known you]. I'm so glad that your [love for;humanity] matches my own. I was [serious about;joining the Peace Corps], [if you really want to;go]!

It's not just our [desire to;serve others], though. I love that you [enjoy playing;sports] and [spending time in;the great outdoors] as much as I do. [I can't wait to;do some hiking and backpacking together] this summer. When are we going to take that [trip down the;Colorado] that you talked about? [I still can't believe;you've already gone down it ten times], and yet [you say that;it's a new adventure] each time. Well, that's how I feel [every time that we;go out together]. Every day that I'm with you is [full of;bright hope] and offers a new adventure.

[I can't wait to;see you] again. [I hope you;know how much you're starting to mean to me]. The other girls I've dated in the past just fade in comparison. You're quickly becoming the only one for me. [I hope that I;will soon be the only one for you].
