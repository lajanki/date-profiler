# I'd Like to Get to Know You Better

I'll always [be grateful to;Brian] for [inviting me to;his party] last night because meeting you became the [highlight of;my evening]. I'm also grateful he was willing to [pass you;this note] in his English Lit. Class. [I hope that you;remember me]. I was [the one with;the buzz cut] and [my mind was;on the tests we're running in my statistics class].

[Although we;didn't spend much time together at the party], it was long enough for me to find out that we have [a few things;in common]. [How many;girls today think that the graduate statistics class is interesting and something they want to talk about?] I was happy to find one who was comfortable discussing [the differences between;a Tukey's test and an items analysis]--for a little while, anyway! And I bet you don't know too many guys [who watched;Pride and Prejudice] on public television and enjoyed it--well, most of it! I still need you to explain to me exactly [who was proud;]and who was prejudiced.

I was hoping [we could get;together] on Friday for lunch [in the;campus cafeteria] [and discuss;it]--my treat. I'll call you the day before [to see if;you can make it]. Brian also gave me your phone number--[I hope you;don't mind]. [I'd really like;to see you again].

P. S. I'm sending this with the hope that [you are;unattached] and actually [want to;see me again]. [I may be;only dreaming] (if I am, [please be;kind]).
