# I'd Like to Get to Know You Better

[Do you remember;meeting me] [at the company;function] last week? I was the man [sitting next to;you] trying to [listen to the;speaker], and hoping you wouldn't notice that my eyes kept [wandering to;you], [your flawless;face], and your flowing hair. It has taken me a week to find the right words to express [what is in my;heart], to compose these words that I hope will capture the sincere [feelings of;my heart]. It is my fervent hope that [we can;get to know each other]. [You have been;in my thoughts] constantly [since I;met you].

After meeting you only once, [my heart;and my world have changed]. I know from our brief meeting that we have much in common in our work and [our love;of life]. Heaven must be [missing an;angel], [because you are;here on earth], [a vision of;loveliness]. It would be a [great honor to;meet you again], if for nothing more than [to see if;your wings are attached].

[Please write;back] if you will consider giving me the privilege of phoning you to [set up a;date].

Finally, [I hope I've;gotten the words right]. I'll be praying that heaven doesn't call you back before I hear from you. [My dreams will;be of you], my angel.
