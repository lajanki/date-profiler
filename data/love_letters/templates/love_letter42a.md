# We Need To Slow Down

I hope you know that [I care;a great deal about you], too. I [will always remember;the fun times that we have had together]. But [I'm worried that;we're going too far, too fast]. We really haven't known each other very long, and I'm just [not ready to;make too strong a commitment] yet. We still have [a lot to learn about;each other]; you might yet discover that my halo wobbles now and then!

We haven't really talked a whole lot [about previous;relationships], but I've learned from experience that [it is best to;take these things slowly]. [I've made;mistakes], and I've been hurt badly in the past by people that I never should have let myself care about as much as I did. I don't know--[maybe you;have too]? I [don't want;that to happen again]. Your friendship means a lot to me, and I [don't want;to ruin] that by letting our emotions (and our hormones!) rule our heads.

[I still want to;spend time with you], I still [look forward to;spending time with you], but [I've got to;take things more slowly] (at least for a while). [Why don't we;try toning things down a little]--[maybe try;only going out about once a week]? Then we can have [time to see;other people] if we want to, and we can allow our friendship to continue to develop [without getting;quickly in way over our heads].

I hope you [won't stop;writing altogether]. I love reading your letters! [Take care of;yourself].
