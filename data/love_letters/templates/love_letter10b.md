# Last Night Was Amazing!

I don't know how I [made it;home] last night. Did I drive, walk, fly? I hazily recall walking [through my;front door] and [collapsing on;my bed]. Then I spent many sweet and sleepless hours vividly thinking of you--each detail of your face, your voice, your touch.

[You swept me;off my feet] (literally!) and [my heart;has never beaten so fast]. I cannot find the [words to describe;my feelings]. How can I express the ways you're [changing my;life]? Simply saying, "[I love;you]" seems so inadequate. My affection is so much greater than those [three little;words]. Forgive me for [not being;more eloquent]; just try to sense in those deceptively simple words the profound depth of feeling within me. [I love;you], Jane. [I cannot say;it any better].

No one in my life [compares to;you]. [No one ever;could]. [I don't need to;search further]; there is no one else I'd rather [spend my;life with]. All [my past;relationships] pale in comparison to my life with you in vivid, vibrant colors. This morning, I heard Nat King Cole on the radio singing, "[The Very;Thought of You]." He was singing just what I want to [say to;you].

The mere [idea of;you], the longing here for you...

You'll never know how slow the moments go [till I'm;near to you]...

[When can I;see you again]? I want to [do something special;for you]. Name the day, and I'll [plan a;night] for us both to remember.
