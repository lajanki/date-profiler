# We've Come To A Standstill

Is it just me, or [has our;relationship become stagnant] [after three months of;being together]? [I'm not sure;where we are heading], and [I believe we;need to take new steps in our relationship].

I'm doing [a lot of;soul-searching] and self-evaluation, and [I want you to;do the same]. I'm not thrilled with our relationship the way it is. [We have no;clear direction], and [I cannot;continue like this any longer].

I need to know [how you feel about;us], and [where you would;like to see us in the near future].

[Could we;get together] on Friday evening, around 8 and talk?
