# Happy Anniversary!

[You are the;love of my life].

Our marriage has always been my greatest [source of;peace] and happiness. [Spending time with;you] is all that I want, because [that's when I;feel the most contented]. I love you, and I want to thank you for the [many wonderful;years] we've spent together.

[I hope these;flowers] will bring a smile to your face and make our special day even brighter for you. I remember [the first time I;brought you flowers]. We hadn't known each other very long, and I wasn't sure how you'd [react to;receiving a gift] from me. You don't know how happy I felt when [you threw;your arms around me] and [gave me a;hug]!

[You've always been;open] and [honest about;your feelings]--that is something I've always cherished about you. There's something else [I love about;you]. [When life has;overwhelmed me], your reassuring voice and [words of;wisdom] have [helped to;get me through]. You [know how to;encourage me], [raise my;spirits], and never [fail to make;me feel good].

Remember when we had been dating only a short while and I [invited you to;one of my basketball games]?--the game I lost single-handedly? I was trying so hard to impress you that I took my [eyes off the;ball] and ended up [knocking over;the other team's water table]. The game didn't improve as I injured fans with my wild passes and shot a record twelve air balls. I was sure that [our relationship was;doomed], but every time I looked over at you, you were smiling that big beautiful smile of yours and cheering me on. Our marriage has been [full of;similar, uplifting experiences]. No matter what whirlwinds surround me, [I can always;count on your support]. You've always been [an example of;selfless love].

With each passing year, [our love has;grown], and you just become more beautiful to me. On our wedding day, [I promised to;love you forever]. That promise is sacred to me--the easiest promise I've ever had or wanted to keep. I reaffirm my promise to [always love;you].

Happy anniversary, Sweetheart. [Thank you for;always being there]!
