# Can We Kiss And Make up?

Politics! If that's all we ever disagree about, then [I think we're;doing okay]. I'm [sorry about;this last disagreement]. Looking back now, [it seems so;silly]. [We hardly ever;fight] like that! I know that I said some things in anger that I didn't mean and [sincerely regretted;very quickly]. [I hope you can;forgive me] and [forget about;it]. [I'm really;sorry].

I think that it can be a good thing that we have different [opinions on;some things]. [Don't you think;it would get boring] if we both always thought the same way about a subject? The way I look at it is, [at least we;feel comfortable enough with each other to be honest and express our true opinions]. [We usually have;great communication]; so what if [we don't always;agree]? That's normal and [it's bound to;happen].

[I'm really;sorry] for the mean things that I said. In the future, let's both [try to;express ourselves calmly] without getting so upset if we disagree because that's when we [say things we;regret] and [feelings can;get hurt]. How about if we have dinner tomorrow night at our favorite Italian bistro and begin to [forget about;this whole thing]?

[You know I;love you].
