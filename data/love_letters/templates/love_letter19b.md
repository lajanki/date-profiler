# I'm Falling For You

Before I met you, I had never taken much [notice of;flowers] or dew or grass or birds. But [this morning I;walked outside], breathed in the crisp, spring air, sat quietly on the porch, and watched life happen. Then, when time forced me [back into the;real world], [I arrived at;work] and tried to concentrate, but couldn't. [When I looked;at my computer screen], I saw your beautiful face and when I jotted notes, [I found myself;printing your name]. [Even when I;broke for lunch], [I remembered;our date], [the smell of;your hair], your perfume, your playful laugh. Everywhere I looked, I remembered you!

[Since I;met you], my world is coming alive. The more I get to know you the more I feel something warm and beautiful stirring within me. Is this feeling what poets have struggled to [describe as;love]? All I know is that [I feel happy and;complete] when I am with you. [When we are;apart], I am lethargic and unfocused. I find myself watching the clock as it ticks off the moments [until we can;be together again].

I learn something new [with every;conversation]. I am impressed that [you can easily;converse about Bach one moment and French cuisine in another]. I was so pleased to learn that we share a common interest in [educating;children]. I have often wondered [if I was;alone in my thinking], but you confirmed that these ideas might have real merit. [That's just;the point]: [you're full of;surprises] - [I never know;what new and wonderful thing I will learn] when I'm with you.

Please pardon my awkward attempt at saying how much I treasure [our growing;relationship]. [I hope you;feel the same way]. The girls I've dated in the past are like vague memories. I've totally [lost interest in;anyone but you].

[I've planned a;surprise] for our date this Saturday night, but I'm [only giving;one hint] - [please wear a;formal dress]. That's all I'll say for now. [I hope you;can come]. I'll call you tomorrow night.
