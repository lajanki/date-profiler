# Goodbye Forever

This letter is probably long overdue, but I put it off [because I;loved you], [I wanted things;to work out], and I [didn't want to;hurt you]. But [the time has;come]. Our relationship just isn't working anymore. It [is causing;more pain than joy for both of us].

There's no point [going over;our problems]; we both know [what they;are]. And we also both know [everything we've;done to try to work them out]. And we have tried, haven't we? We had some really great talks about what [needed to;change], [but nothing;did]. We even sought professional help but, apparently, [we were;past that point already].

[I've thought about;this] a lot and I know in my heart that [we will both;be happier with other people]. [I will not be;coming back]. We both need to [move on with;our lives] and [find relationships;better suited to our individual needs].

We loved each other well--for a time. A small part of my heart will always remember that love and [remember the;happy times] we had together, for [there were;many].

I truly wish you [the best of;luck and happiness] in your life--[with your;job], with your family, and with [finding a new;love].
