# Sorry We Didn't Agree

I cannot [tell you how;sad I now feel after our argument]. Please forgive [my many;faults] and [the many;pains] I have caused you. How thoughtless and foolish I have been! I wish that I could [wash out;any spot of unhappiness] I have caused you. [I know I have;said hurtful things]. [I ask you to;forget them], because the truth is that [you are a;great person] and I had [no right to;put you down].

I will call you soon, but in the meantime, [please try to;forgive me]. [I am very;sorry]. Please [give me another;chance]. I love you.
