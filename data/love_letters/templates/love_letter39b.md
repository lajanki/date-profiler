# We Need To See A Marriage Counselor

[Because we;parted last night in anger], [I decided to;write you a letter rather than call]. [We both needed to;cool off a little] and [think about what's;happening to us]. [I don't really know;when our arguments first started] (do you?), but [we can't seem to;resolve them peacefully] anymore. Although our passionate natures helped to bring us together in the first place, they have also meant that [both of us have;hair triggers on our tempers]. We don't seem to be able to sit down and [discuss a;problem] like [two rational;people] anymore. [With our;volatile personalities], we just [get angry and;start fighting], then make up later [when the memory;fades] and [we start to;miss each other]. [This behavior is;beginning] to form a recurrent [pattern that;we can't seem to break].

[We've been together;for almost five years now], so we've invested a few [years of;our lives] into this relationship already and should [think twice before;we throw it away]. [When it is;good], it is very, very good, but [those times are;getting further and further apart]. Now we need to decide [if there's enough;love] here to hold on to, or if this relationship has just run its course and we should give it up. [I know I still;love you], Christy. If you love me too, then together [we could try to;find the road back to the way we were]. I'm just afraid we need [someone else to;help us do that now].

The worse things get, the more I think we need to find someone who'll show us [how to settle;our arguments peacefully]. Maybe this person could even help us [figure out why;we're arguing in the first place]. It may take a little work, but it would be worth it if we could [start to build;new memories as great as the old ones]. I'll call you Sunday evening to see how you feel about [going to a;counselor with me]. Sweetheart, let's [hold on to;what we've got] and not let it slip away!

My sweetie, [please don't;make me wait a lonely lifetime]. If you promise to, I will.

I love you.
