# My Love Is Real And So Is My Commitment

I've just been sitting here [recalling what my;life was like before I met you]. Life! That's a joke. Eight months ago life meant [going through;the motions], monotonous movements, no joy, no sadness, no ups, and no downs--just one long [stream of;tedium]. Then Bill [invited me to;a party] (my stomach turns over when I [remember how I;almost said no]!). And there you were--beautiful, happy, intelligent and incredible. [Suddenly, I;came alive]--and [I've been;alive] ever since.

It happened that very first night--I fell [in love with;you]. [How do I;know]? Because the feeling never left me and it has grown ever since. I think it always will. The lights went on. Instantly, [life was;exciting]; colors seemed brighter; songs crisper; tastes more enjoyable. I ceased walking and began leaping. I realized that [there is a;whole wonderful world ready to explore]--[with the right;person].

With you, [I am at;ease]. I don't have to try so hard to [talk about;movies] or music or politics or sports--or our favorite subjects: [horseback riding and;chess] ([who would have thought I;could find someone with those interests in common]?). I love [being with;you] when we split a caramel sundae, stroll the park hand-in-hand without [having to force;a conversation], and cuddle up in front of the TV. Simple pleasures. I'm content and [happy when;I am with you].

I love you. From the depths of my heart, I love you to an extent that I never thought possible, and [I know I;always will]. [I cannot imagine;life without you] now. [I want my;life to be your life]. I want to spend every minute of every day with you. I want to [experience all;that life has to offer]--the good and the bad--[with you at;my side]. I [want to grow;up and grow old with you]. I want to [hold you;in my arms] and never let you go. I want to feel [the warmth of;your kiss] and whisper [words of;love] into your ear. You are [all that is;good and beautiful]; you [satisfy all;the longing] that was in me--body and soul. Tell me [I will never;again be relegated to a colorless, mundane world].

[As I sit;here in the quiet of my room] [trying to;compose this letter] and express [feelings that;poets have struggled to say], I am reminded of lyrics that might say it best: "[Who knows how;long I've loved you]? You know I love you still. Will I wait a lonely lifetime? [If you;promise to], I will."

My sweetie, [please don't;make me wait a lonely lifetime]. [If you;promise to], I will.

I love you.
