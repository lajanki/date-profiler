# Tell Me What You're Thinking

How are you doing, my love? [Things are;pretty good] on this end of campus. I had a [great time with;you] last night at the baseball game. I never would have guessed you were such [an avid;sports fan]! [You can;holler] with the best of them. You [never cease to;amaze] me.

You know, I was thinking last night after I dropped you off that [we've been;seeing each other] [for almost;six months now]. Time really flies, doesn't it? I've really enjoyed [spending time;together] and getting to know you. And yet, [as I was;looking back], I realized that [there is still a lot;I don't know about you]. Rather, there is so much more that I would like to [know about;you]. Obviously I know quite a bit about some things, though. I [know about;you]r [job with the;botany professor], for example, and about how your classes are going, and [some of the things that;are happening with you and your roommates].

[We are always;busy]; [we both have;our classes and work]. [We always have;plenty to talk about], but [I don't think we ever;really go much beyond the surface]. [It seems we have;discussed anything and everything]--and yet nothing. I'm curious--[what are your;real dreams and ambitions]? [What would you like to;accomplish]? What do you see yourself wanting to be in ten, twenty, or fifty years? What is your [greatest goal in;life]?

Who knows, [maybe you have;wondered the same things about me]. I was thinking that [it would be great to;get away on Saturday (leave school, work, friends, roommates, whatever)] and just spend some uninterrupted time together. [It's been a while since we've;done that]. [We could go;hiking up to Promissory Point], have a picnic lunch, and just [talk about our;plans and hopes for the future]--and anything else that comes to mind or that you would like to discuss. I think it would be really good for us, and it would [help us to get;to know an aspect of each other that we really haven't explored before].

[What do you;say]? I'll stop by after my calc class tomorrow afternoon to see [if that will;work].

[I can't wait to;see you].
