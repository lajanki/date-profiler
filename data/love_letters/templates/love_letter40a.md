# It's Time We Let Someone Come Between Us

[I don't know;exactly what you're thinking these days], but I'm pretty sure that you are as aware as I am that [things have been;a little rocky between us lately]. Well, a lot rocky, really. [We've always had;our differences]--remember how we always teased that opposites attract and that fighting was worth it because making up was so much fun? [Over the last;few months], though, it seems that [we've been fighting;all the time] and we don't see eye-to-eye on anything anymore. We've both become quite independent over the last couple of years as our careers have [started to take;shape], and we're not nearly as easygoing as we used to be.

In the past we could always compromise and work together through our challenges, but [things just aren't;getting better this time]. [I keep thinking that;these little difficulties will vanish], but they don't. [We make;resolutions to be better partners], yet nothing changes.

I [don't want to;give up on us]. I love you--it seems like I've loved you forever now. I don't want to [let go of;this relationship], and I don't [want to lose;you]. [We've been so;close] in the past, [had so many;good times], and we've both [grown a;great deal]. [Could we really;let all of that come to an end]?

I don't know what more we can do. These days we seem to be [talking in;circles], unable (or unwilling?) to [listen to;each other]. [Life's just not;as simple as it used to be]. I know that in the past I was [hesitant to;involve other people in our problems], but now I think that it might be wise to seek outside help if we want this relationship to last. Honey, are we [ready to do;that]? I hope so.

I have a friend who was [going through;some marital problems] about a year ago. At that time [she mentioned a;counselor that she was seeing], and she spoke very highly of her. Will you call me by this weekend and [tell me what;you think about possibly seeing this guidance counselor if she's available]? Hope to hear from you soon. I love you.
