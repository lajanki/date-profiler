# This Relationship Is Worth Saving

I am sorry. [I don't want you to;think that I'm saying those words lightly]. [I really mean;them]. [I am so;sorry]. I know that [what I did was;wrong] and I know that it hurt you deeply. I'm [not sure what;I was thinking], but I do know that [I never wanted to;hurt you]. [I wish I could;take it back], but I can't. All I can do is [try to show you;how much I regret what I've done] and [ask for your;forgiveness].

I love you. We have certainly had our share of problems in the past, but we've always been [able to;work through them]. I think we're actually [stronger because of;them]. [I hope that this;situation is no different]. I will do [whatever it takes;for you to trust me again], so that we can [go back to;the way things were].

We've had [too many;good times together] to break up over this. I take [full responsibility for;my mistake], so please don't [give up on;me] now. Remember the good times like [when we went;parasailing] in Florida or when [we bought our;dog]. [Remember how;happy we were]? I know it can be that way again. [Please forgive;me].

[I want to;see you] this weekend. I want to [start making;it up to you]. How about if I make dinner at my place and we [rent a good;movie]? We can cuddle up on the couch [under a big;blanket] and just [enjoy being;together]. Think about it, and [I'll call you;tonight].
