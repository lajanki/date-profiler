# Sorry, This Isn't Working For Me Anymore

I'm sorry that I [didn't get;in touch with you yesterday]. I'm sure that you were [surprised when;you got home last night] and found me (and some of my stuff) gone. A couple of days ago my friend Dan said he needed a house sitter for a few months while he went [out of town;on business], and when I mentioned that it might be good to have some time and space to myself for a while, he took up my offer to housesit for him.

You know as well as I do that [things haven't been;going very well between us lately]. [It seems as;if we fight all the time]. I don't even know if we really [try to get;along anymore]. [Every time;we make an effort to resolve things], we just [end up;flinging insults] and hurting each other more. [We've stopped;really listening to one another], and it's as if we've really stopped caring. We [used to be;so loving and good to each other], but now it seems as if all we do is [count each other's;imperfections]. From time to time we try to make amends and [make things;better], but [nothing seems to;work].

Now, I know that every coin has a flip side, so I'm certainly not [blaming you for;what has happened]. The truth is that [we're both;at fault]; I'm as much to blame as you are for [the problems that;we have]. I just [don't think;this is a very healthy relationship for either one of us anymore].

I need [some time to;think about things] and [try to gain;some perspective], so I feel that it would be best if we don't see each other for a while. That doesn't mean [I think we;shouldn't contact each other at all]. You mean a great deal to me, Jodi, and I'll [never forget;the good times that we've shared]. [Things just aren't;working out right now], and we need to find out if separating for the time being will help us to [remember why;we first got together]. We might also discover that we would be [better off;just being friends], or maybe even [ending the;relationship] altogether. In any case, whatever happens, [please know that;I love you], and that [I want the;best for you] always.

[Wishing you;the best]!
