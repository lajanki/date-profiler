# Let's Reconsider Our Goals

[We've been;together now] [for almost;a year]. Overall, [it's been a;great year]. [You know I;love you], but lately it seems as though [things have come;to a complete standstill]. [We're not;moving forward] anymore. I want you to [be a part of;my life], but [I can't continue;the way things are]. I'm not happy because I'm unclear as to exactly [what we're;doing] or [where we're;going].

The short term goals that we set have all been accomplished, and it's time to set some [new goals for;our relationship]. I would like to see us spend more time together, talk more, share more, and [take the relationship;a step further]. [How do you;feel]? [Do you want;the same thing]?

[Can we;talk about] this? I'll call you.
