# We're Made For Each Other!

[I've noticed;something recently] - [I'm;happy]. My attitude at work has improved. My [attitude about;life] has improved. I smile most of the time and [sometimes I;find myself humming] as I [walk down;the street]. Other people have noticed it too and asked me [what's different;now] and [what has made;me so much happier]. The answer? I can trace the change back to the time [when I first;met you].

I love [spending time with;you]. The more I learn about you, the more [I want to;be with you]. You make me [want to try;new things]. Who would ever have thought that [I would try;rock climbing]? I'm usually [afraid of;heights] and [afraid of;falling], and yet there I was, halfway up the [side of a;mountain] and enjoying it. [I hardly;felt scared] at all!

[We're so;different] and yet [we're so;alike]. You're an extrovert and I'm [more of an;introvert]. You love doing adventurous outdoor activities, and I tend to [be afraid of;doing anything out of the ordinary]. [Our political;differences] [may lead to;some heated discussions], [but we also;complement each other] in so many other ways. We have the same quirky [sense of;humor] and the same [desire to learn;new things]. And [we respect;each other's opinions], whether we agree with them or not. [I think I could;talk to you nonstop for a week] and not [run out of;things to say]!

[I think I'm;falling in love with you]. I don't have any [desire to be;with anyone else]; I just want to be with you. I hope that we can [continue down;this path] and see where it leads. I can't wait until [our next;date].
