# I Want To Spend The Rest Of My Life With You

From the first moment that I [saw you;standing] in the comedy aisle at Blockbuster, [I knew that;we would be together]. [I don't know;how]; I don't usually [believe in;that sort of thing], but [somehow I;knew]. Maybe it was the fact that [you were holding;an Adam Sandler DVD in your hand (I love his movies!)]. Maybe it was the fact that you were [wearing shorts;in December]. Maybe it was [the way you;looked at me as I walked by]. I'll probably [never know;exactly what caused it], but I just [knew that you;were the one].

[Ever since;that day], [I have been;happy]. I never imagined that someone could be this happy all the time and it's [all because of;you]. You are the reason that I [find myself;singing those old '80s love songs] [in the;shower]. You are the reason that [I sometimes get;the urge to run down the street laughing]. And you are the reason that I smile so often now. All I have to do is [picture your;face] and think of [our last;meeting].

I enjoy so many of the [things that we;do together]. I love talking with you, [discussing current;events], or just our normal days. I love [taking walks with;you] in the mountains, having picnics, and enjoying the beauty around us. But simply watching TV together makes me content. I don't need [anything except;to be with you]. I love you. [That will never;change]. I am [committed to;us]. I am committed to our future together.

I truly believe that we were [meant to;be together]. I [look forward to;spending the rest of my life with you].
