# Too Many Things Have Come Between Us

[Do you remember;how things used to be]? [We couldn't;say hello or goodbye] without a kiss. Sometimes we'd grab our coats and hats and take long [walks around;the city], holding hands and [talking about;almost everything]. We'd jump in the car late Friday night and just drive up north to find some romantic bed and breakfast where we could [spend the;weekend]--[far away from;our jobs], our families, and [our real;lives]. [All we wanted;was to be together]. We loved those weekend trips and we always [came back;rejuvenated] and so much in love.

[Things have;changed] since then. I didn't want them to and [I don't think you;wanted them to either]. It [started with;small things]. You'd come home from work and I'd be [busy making;dinner] and [forget to;kiss you hello]. At some point we decided that it was too cold to take long [walks around;the city] and that it would be better just to stay home, but it seems all we talk about now is the weather and [what needs to;be done]. And it's been almost [a year since;our last weekend trip]. What happened?

[I love;you] so much and [I want those;days] back. [I want to;talk] and share everything with you again. I know that [your job has;gotten a lot busier] and that promotion you received [came with;increased responsibility]. Our weekend trips might not be as spontaneous as before, [but we could;plan a week or two in advance]. We could bundle up a little and plan [a walk on;a night] when you will be [getting home;fairly early]. Or maybe we could [go to the;mall] and hold hands while we talk and window shop. That would keep the cold [out of;the equation]. [We could start;new traditions], too. Perhaps I could greet you one night with a bubble bath and join you and [wash your;back].

What I'm trying to say is that [I love;you]. I want this relationship to work; [I don't want;it to fizzle and die]. I'm [willing to;fight] to get it back so it will at least resemble the way it was before, before we let jobs and routines get in the way of [remembering why;we loved to be together].

[I've got a;surprise] for you. Remember [our favorite;bed and breakfast]? The one that had [the enormous;fireplace] and the beautiful canopy bed? [I've made;reservations] for next weekend. That gives us both [time to;settle other responsibilities] so we can get away and start to reignite the passion and love that we are losing.

[I love;you].
