Do you remember;meeting me
at the company;function
sitting next to;you
listen to the;speaker
listen to;the speaker
wandering to;you
the right words to;express what is in my heart
what is in my;heart
feelings of;my heart
we can;get to know each other
You have been;in my thoughts
we have much;in common in our work and our love of life
our love;of life
missing an;angel
because you are;here on earth
a vision of;loveliness
to see if;your wings are attached
set up a;date
set up;a date
I hope I've;gotten the words right
My dreams will;be of you
My dreams;will be of you
your flawless;face
since I;met you
my heart;and my world have changed
great honor to;meet you again
great honor to;meet you
Please write;back
giving me the;privilege of phoning you to set up a date
