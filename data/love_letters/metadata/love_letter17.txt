spending time with;you
over the last;few week
Getting to know;you
the world looks;a little better
the sun shines;a little brighter
I'm not;exaggerating
you're the;kindest
I want to;know
You're;incredible
changed the;way I see the world
the way I;see the world
I want to be;an even better person
because I have;known you
love for;humanity
serious about;joining the Peace Corps
desire to;serve others
spending time in;the great outdoors
I can't wait to;do some hiking and backpacking together
trip down the;Colorado
you say that;it's a new adventure
every time that we;go out together
full of;bright hope
I can't wait to;see you
I hope that I;will soon be the only one for you
I will soon;be the only one for you
I wish I could;really express the happiness I have found in spending time with you over the last few weeks
express the;happiness I have found in spending time with you over the last few weeks
Every time we;are together
The more I learn about;you
learn about;you
I am a;better person
joining the;Peace Corps
if you really want to;go
enjoy playing;sports
I still can't believe;you've already gone down it ten times
I hope you;know how much you're starting to mean to me
