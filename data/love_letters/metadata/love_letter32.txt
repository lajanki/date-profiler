walked away from;me last night
wondering what;I had done to upset you
we've had;our differences
we've always;been able to talk them out
I have said;something that you have misunderstood
replayed our;conversation
try to identify;the subject or phrase or action
My intention is;never to offend you
I think you know;that
patient with;me
how to communicate;on a level that does not cause offense
does not cause;offense
along with this;note
If you count;them
one for each;week that we have known each other
Would you see;me again
Will you teach me;how to do better
how to do;better
Could we;pick up the pieces
I promise to;do better
tickets for;this Saturday night
I know we;can work through this
give me another;chance
such a good;relationship
Let's hold;onto it
Please say;you'll go out with me
I want to;make it right
feel your;forgiveness
I promise to;do better
I stood in;the darkness
able to talk;them out
I truly;apologize
Please accept;the flowers
I have made;reservations
