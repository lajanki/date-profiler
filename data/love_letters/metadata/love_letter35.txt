I'm sorry;we fought last night
It was my;fault
ended up;taking it out on you
I say things;that I don't really mean
I end up;opening my mouth without thinking
that's never;a good thing
I'm normally;a very calm and rational person
that doesn't;make it right
I hope you can;forgive me
the way we;work together
I can't even remember;what it was
I remember how;she called you to talk about it and apologize
I hope you;can be that forgiving with me
I occasionally;get unreasonable
say things;that I don't mean
able to get;tickets to that hockey game you wanted to see
forget that;this ever happened
I'm hoping I;can pick you up at 5
I'm hoping;I can pick you up at 5
you were very;upset
