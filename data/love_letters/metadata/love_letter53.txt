how well we;fit together
we are only;whole
I thought I was;happy
I know what;true happiness is
changed my;life
I never knew;that little things could mean so much
When I start to;fall asleep
cover me with;a blanket
when you're done with;your shower
and it's my;turn
when you know;I've had a really hard day
I've had a;really hard day
you always;suggest we go out to dinner
I like to do;little things
I don't even think;about it
I don't even;think about it
I just want to;do something to make your day better
do something to;make your day better
When you have to;work late
I bring you;dinner
you tell me all;about it
I know you'll;always be there for me
I hope you know;that you mean the world to me
I know I'd;only be half the woman that I am today
what I would do if;I ever lost you
I'd only be;half the woman that I am today
I feel like we;are parts of a puzzle that fit together perfectly
go out to;dinner
I always put;a love note
