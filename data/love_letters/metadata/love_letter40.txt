I don't know;exactly what you're thinking these days
what you're;thinking
things have been;a little rocky between us lately
We've always had;our differences
Over the last;few months
we've been fighting;all the time
things just aren't;getting better this time
I keep thinking that;these little difficulties will vanish
We make;resolutions to be better partners
don't want to;give up on us
let go of;this relationship
want to lose;you
We've been so;close
had so many;good times
grown a;great deal
Could we really;let all of that come to an end
talking in;circles
we seem to;be talking in circles
listen to;each other
Life's just not;as simple as it used to be
hesitant to;involve other people in our problems
in our;problems
ready to do;that
going through;some marital problems
she mentioned a;counselor that she was seeing
tell me what;you think about possibly seeing this guidance counselor if she's available
started to take;shape
I have a friend who;was going through some marital problems about a year ago
