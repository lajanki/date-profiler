After being;your best friend
all my hopes;and desires
what will;make me happy
what will make;me happy
what will make me;happy
You have always been;there for me
through our;ups and downs
I love being;with you
you've put;up with me and all the crazy things I do
all the crazy;things I do
acting like;fools
You are the;best friend I have ever had
I just love;everything about you
everything about;you
But then I;thought about you
when I was;trying to go to sleep
that day we;went mudding on the four wheelers
trying to;go to sleep
I thought about;that day we went mudding on the four wheelers
thinking about all;the other boys
and I couldn't;stop thinking about you!
people I want to;be with
I want to be;with you
forever and;a day
