we need to;slow down
that's not a;feeling I'm comfortable with
no longer in;control
don't want;that to happen to us
I really do;like you
I enjoy the;time that we spend together
a lot of;stress
what happens to;our relationship
I'm starting to;get anxious
I don't want this;to be the end
I'd like to keep;seeing you
not ready to;commit myself only to you
continue to get;to know each other
get too;serious
we can still;see each other
It feels like;our relationship is moving so fast that I'm no longer in control
love to see;you
but I'm just;not ready to get too serious right now
not quite as;often
