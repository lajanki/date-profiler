Do you remember;how things used to be
We couldn't;say hello or goodbye
couldn't say;hello or goodbye
walks around;the city
talking about;almost everything
find some;romantic bed and breakfast where we could spend the weekend
spend the;weekend
far away from;our jobs
our real;lives
All we wanted;was to be together
came back;rejuvenated
Things have;changed
I don't think you;wanted them to either
started with;small things
busy making;dinner
forget to;kiss you hello
too cold to;take long walks around the city
what needs to;be done
a year since;our last weekend trip
I want those;days
I want to;talk
your job has;gotten a lot busier
came with;increased responsibility
but we could;plan a week or two in advance
a walk on;a night
getting home;fairly early
go to the;mall
out of;the equation
We could start;new traditions
wash your;back
I love;you
willing to;fight
remembering why;we loved to be together
I've got a;surprise
our favorite;bed and breakfast
the enormous;fireplace
I've made;reservations
time to;settle other responsibilities
it's been almost;a year
I don't want;it to fizzle and die
