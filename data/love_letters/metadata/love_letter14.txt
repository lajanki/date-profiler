when you told;me you were leaving
you were;leaving
I was sitting;in the chaise by the fireplace
I was wearing;my black skirt
remember all the;details
how I;felt
I was left with;this cold fear in the pit of my stomach
I can't say that;I was totally surprised
I was totally;surprised
because we;loved each other
I've thought;a lot about it
worse than;I let myself believe
things were;worse than I let myself believe
you weren't;happy
trying to talk;about it
you went;away
how I always;considered my own wants and needs before yours
effort required to;make things work
make things;work
if you think;that's a good idea
things will be;different this time
focus on being;much less selfish
acted like;it
I realize what;I had
how much I;have lost
our first;date
we can talk about;getting back together
really want to;see you again
waiting for;you
Our relationship;had been suffering for awhile
it was just a;bump in the road that we would get over
it was just;a bump in the road that we would get over
I want you to;come back
I am willing to;put forth whatever effort required to make things work
Let's go see a;counselor
Let's go see;a counselor
I promise that;things will be different this time
things will be;different this time
Please, let's;meet
getting back;together
