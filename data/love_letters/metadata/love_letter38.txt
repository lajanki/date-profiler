recalling what my;life was like before I met you
before I;met you
going through;the motions
stream of;tedium
invited me to;a party
remember how I;almost said no
Suddenly, I;came alive
I've been;alive
in love with;you
How do I;know
life was;exciting
there is a;whole wonderful world ready to explore
ready to;explore
with the right;person
I am at;ease
talk about;movies
horseback riding and;chess
who would have thought I;could find someone with those interests in common
being with;you
having to force;a conversation
happy when;I am with you
I know I;always will
I cannot imagine;life without you
I want my;life to be your life
experience all;that life has to offer
with you at;my side
want to grow;up and grow old with you
hold you;in my arms
the warmth of;your kiss
words of;love
all that is;good and beautiful
satisfy all;the longing
I will never;again be relegated to a colorless, mundane world
As I sit;here in the quiet of my room
trying to;compose this letter
feelings that;poets have struggled to say
Who knows how;long I've loved you
If you;promise to
please don't;make me wait a lonely lifetime
