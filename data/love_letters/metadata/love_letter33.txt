I can tell;that you're upset with me
You haven't;called me in three days
when I've tried to;call you
can't figure out;what I did to turn you against me
turn you;against me
the last time I;saw you
too tired;to
you didn't seem;upset
If I did;do something
didn't mean to;hurt you
I love;you
hate it when;you're unhappy with me
unhappy with;me
Could we please;meet
something that;bothered you
I did something;that bothered you
maybe we could;have dinner
some kind of;an understanding
we could go to;a hockey game
Please think;about it
I want to get;everything out in the open
