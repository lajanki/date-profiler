the day we;met
You have been;the highlight of my life
You have been the;highlight of my life
dream of;you
When your heart;beats
We have been;friends
without my;thinking of you
I feel;warm
my heart;skips a beat
remember the;first day we met
the first;day we met
in love with;our best friend
Do you feel;the same way about me
Do you;feel the same way
made it;skip a beat
across my;face
the biggest;smile
on the;phone
in the same;room
looking into;your eyes
in the same;room
I fell for;you
