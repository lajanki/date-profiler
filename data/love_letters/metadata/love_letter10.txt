don't know how;I made it home last night
made it;home
through my;front door
collapsing on;my bed
You swept me;off my feet
my heart;has never beaten so fast
words to describe;my feelings
How can I express;the ways you're changing my life
changing my;life
I love;you
three little;words
not being;more eloquent
I cannot say;it any better
I cannot;say it any better
compares to;you
No one ever;could
I don't need to;search further
spend my;life with
my past;relationships
The Very;Thought of You
what I want to;say to you
say to;you
idea of;you
till I'm;near to you
When can I;see you again
I want to;do something special for you
plan a;night
describe my;feelings
greater than;those three little words
No one in my life;compares to you
there is no one;else I'd rather spend my life with
You'll never;know how slow the moments go till I'm near to you...
how slow;the moments go till I'm near to you...
do something special;for you
