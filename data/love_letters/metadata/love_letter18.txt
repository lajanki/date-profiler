I'm;happy
attitude about;life
sometimes I;find myself humming
walk down;the street
what's different;now
what has made;me so much happier
back to;the time when I first met you
when I first;met you
spending time with;you
I want to;be with you
You make me;want to try new things
want to try;new things
I would try;rock climbing
afraid of;heights
afraid of;falling
side of a;mountain
I hardly;felt scared
We're so;different
we're so;alike
more of an;introvert
I tend to;be afraid of doing anything out of the ordinary
be afraid of;doing anything out of the ordinary
but we also;complement each other
sense of;humor
desire to learn;new things
we respect;each other's opinions
run out of;things to say
I think I'm;falling in love with you
I don't have any;desire to be with anyone else
desire to be;with anyone else
desire to learn;new things
continue down;this path
can't wait until;our next date
our next;date
I've noticed;something recently
I can trace;the change back to the time when I first met you
Our political;differences
may lead to;some heated discussions
We have the same;quirky sense of humor
I think I could;talk to you nonstop for a week
