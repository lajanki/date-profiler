gone for;two weeks now
so much;longer
never been;separated from each other
separated from;each other
it would be;difficult
I would;miss you
I knew that;it would be difficult
didn't realize;how difficult being separated from you this long would really be
separated from;you this long would really be
The worst part;is
going to;bed
end up in;bed
there's;nobody there
I only feel;a cold sheet
being able to;have all of the blankets
all of the;blankets
if you were;just next to me
I have no;one to say goodnight to
no one to;say goodnight to
kiss before;turning out the light
talking to;you in person
When exactly;are you coming home
we can go;out to dinner
all about;your trip
what went right;
people you;worked with while you were there
I have a lot;to tell you
to talk to;you
I just need to;be with you again
I just need;to be with you again
Please come;home soon
I look at the;calendar
out for;you
not the same as;talking to you in person
with my arm;around you
I can't wait to;see you again
while you were;there
I want to hear;every little detail
every little;detail
so excited to;see you again
to hold;you
