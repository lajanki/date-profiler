our relationship has;been in trouble for awhile now
don't know about;you
to admit;it
pretend that;it didn't exist
don't know about;you
I can't go;on like this
responsibility for;my part in our problems
I think that;you do too
you do;too
how to fix;it
We've both;certainly tried
it just hasn't;worked out
in order to save;this marriage
save this;marriage
we need to move;in the right direction toward reconciliation
two of;us
into this;mess
to get us;out
we need to see;a marriage counselor
this marriage is;worth saving
a lot of;work
willing to;do whatever it takes
I hope you;are too
not willing to;just give up the past ten years
the early days of;our marriage
I remember how;happy we were
ran out of;things to say to each other
we used to;talk all night
sometimes we;used to talk all night
I want us to;be like that again
rather be with;our friends
much to say;
I miss;the way we were
Please say;that you'll come with me to talk to a counselor
come with me to;talk to a counselor
I'll find;the counselor
tell me when;you'll be available
