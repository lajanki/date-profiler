how much I appreciate;our friendship
spending time with;you
rushing into;our relationship
we're just;getting to know each other
I've learned from;sad experience
I couldn't;swim
I know you will;respect my feelings
you may be;feeling the same way
still want to;explore different possibilities
the freedom to;date other people
not ready for;an exclusive relationship
I want to keep;seeing you
more aware of;how compatible we are
I've thought about;this
benefit both of;us
promoted into;management
we should;slow down a little
Our relationship has;so much potential
take things;slow and easy
sensitive to;my feelings
feel pressured to;commit to a level of trust and intimacy I'm not ready for
explore different;possibilities
completing my;nursing degree
