how much you;mean to me
thank you for;coming into my life
don't regret;telling you how I feel
telling you;how I feel
through many;relationships
abused by;a guy
I wasn't born;nasty
But you;happened
stole my;heart
At first I;was confused
if I wanted to;take a chance again
I decided to;come close to you as a friend
find out who;you truly were
You seemed;cool
got together with;you
taking me;seriously
too late to;turn back
looking forward to;giving up so soon
I wasn't;going to let you go so easily
time has;passed
discovered new;things about a new me
I'm growing;a deep feeling inside my heart
don't know what;your feelings are
something you don't;really feel towards me
I want to receive;love and trust
show me that;you care for me
coming into;my life
I have been;through many relationships
a guy who;I really loved once
Since then I have;not taken chances with a guy again
Since then I;have not taken chances with a guy again
chances with;a guy
take you;seriously
I actually had;my doubts about you
tried so hard to;know you
You have truly;changed me
