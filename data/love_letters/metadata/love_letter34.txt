I wasn't on;my best behavior
blame you for;being upset
sorry for;the way I acted
not used to;sharing
I'm used to;having you all to myself
That doesn't make;it all right
maybe it will;help you understand why I behaved the way I did last night
sorry for;the pain
make a good;first impression
I didn't;mean it
I don't normally;act that way
Can you;forgive me
fine with;that
patient with;me
Being in this;relationship
I'm in a whole;new world
such a great;time
playing games with;the kids
Watching;you
I saw into;your heart
look up to;you
despite my;faults
you can learn to;love me
Will you let me;take you out to dinner
watch a;movie
Please say;"Yes"
how you are;doing
I guess I'm just;not used to sharing you with your family
