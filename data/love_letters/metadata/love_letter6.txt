because I;loved you
didn't want to;hurt you
didn't want;to hurt you
the time has;come
is causing;more pain than joy for both of us
more pain than;joy for both of us
going over;our problems
everything we've;done to try to work them out
needed to;change
we were;past that point already
we will both;be happier with other people
happier with;other people
find relationships;better suited to our individual needs
the best of;luck and happiness
with your;job
finding a new;love
I wanted things;to work out
what they;are
we have tried;
but nothing;did
I've thought about;this
I will not be;coming back
coming back;
move on with;our lives
remember the;happy times
there were;many
