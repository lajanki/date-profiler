hung up on;me
the last time;I called you
not sure what;I've done to upset you
I know I can;be outspoken and sound offensive at times
can be considered;rude and abrasive
because I'm;falling in love with you
don't take;offense
my intentions are;good
someone with;finer sensibilities
teach me how to;behave here
willing to;take on this great challenge
Would you;mind
have a lot of;benefits
not easy to;get
find out why;it's still so popular
if we can;talk about it face-to-face
I can make;you feel better
give me the;chance
opposite ends of;the country
consider my;intentions
it looks like I;need someone with finer sensibilities to point out my blunders and teach me how to behave here
we could start;going out together again
start going;out together again
We need to make;up
We need to;make up
