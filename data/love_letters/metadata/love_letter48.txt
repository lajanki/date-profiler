has our;relationship become stagnant
after three months of;being together
I'm not sure;where we are heading
I believe we;need to take new steps in our relationship
we need to;take new steps in our relationship
a lot of;soul-searching
I want you to;do the same
We have no;clear direction
I cannot;continue like this any longer
I need to know;how you feel about us
how you feel about;us
where you would;like to see us in the near future
Could we;get together
