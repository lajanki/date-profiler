saw you;standing
I knew that;we would be together
we would be;together
I don't know;how
believe in;that sort of thing
somehow I;knew
you were holding;an Adam Sandler DVD in your hand (I love his movies!)
I love his;movies
wearing shorts;in December
the way you;looked at me as I walked by
never know;exactly what caused it
what caused;it
knew that you;were the one
Ever since;that day
I have been;happy
all because of;you
find myself;singing those old '80s love songs
in the;shower
I sometimes get;the urge to run down the street laughing
the urge to;run down the street laughing
picture your;face
our last;meeting
things that we;do together
discussing current;events
taking walks with;you
anything except;to be with you
That will never;change
committed to;us
meant to;be together
look forward to;spending the rest of my life with you
