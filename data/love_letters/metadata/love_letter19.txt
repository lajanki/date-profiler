notice of;flowers
this morning I;walked outside
forced me;back into the real world
back into the;real world
I arrived at;work
When I looked;at my computer screen
I found myself;printing your name
Even when I;broke for lunch
I remembered;our date
the smell of;your hair
Since I;met you
describe as;love
I feel happy and;complete
When we are;apart
until we can;be together again
with every;conversation
common interest in;educating children
if I was;alone in my thinking
That's just;the point
you're full of;surprises
I never know;what new and wonderful thing I will learn
attempt at;saying how much I treasure our growing relationship
how much I;treasure our growing relationship
our growing;relationship
I hope you;feel the same way
I've totally;lost interest in anyone but you
lost interest in;anyone but you
I've planned a;surprise
only giving;one hint
please wear a;formal dress
please wear;a formal dress
I hope you;can come
I find myself;watching the clock as it ticks off the moments until we can be together again
you can easily;converse about Bach one moment and French cuisine in another
converse about;Bach
educating;children
