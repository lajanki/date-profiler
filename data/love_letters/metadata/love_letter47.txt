Things are;pretty good
great time with;you
an avid;sports fan
You can;holler
never cease to;amaze
we've been;seeing each other
spending time;together
as I was;looking back
there is still a lot;I don't know about you
know about;you
I know about your;job with the botany professor
job with the;botany professor
some of the things that;are happening with you and your roommates
We are always;busy
we both have;our classes and work
We always have;plenty to talk about
I don't think we ever;really go much beyond the surface
beyond the;surface
It seems we have;discussed anything and everything
what are your;real dreams and ambitions
What would you like to;accomplish
greatest goal in;life
maybe you have;wondered the same things about me
talk about our;plans and hopes for the future
It's been a while since we've;done that
We could go;hiking up to Promissory Point
help us to get;to know an aspect of each other that we really haven't explored before
an aspect of;each other
What do you;say
if that will;work
I can't wait to;see you
You never;cease to amaze me
for almost;six months now
there is so much;more that I would like to know about you
things that are happening;with you and your roommates
you and your;roommates
things about;me
it would be great to;get away on Saturday (leave school, work, friends, roommates, whatever)
