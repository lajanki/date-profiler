I'm afraid;if I try to talk to you in person we'll start fighting
we'll start;fighting
we're soon;arguing about something else
arguing about;something else
can't continue;our almost daily spats
saying things;I soon regret
we need to;separate
our lives are;too interconnected
staying at;Rachel's
If you need to;get in touch with me
living without;one another
mixture that;blows up more and more frequently
The bad times are;beginning to outnumber the good
starting to affect;my outlook on life
snapping at my;co-workers
give each other;warning looks
look forward to;coming home anymore
you know I;don't get paid for overtime there
you know I don't;get paid for overtime there
happening to;us
happier than;we are
too precious to;throw away
fighting to;hold on to it
throw away all;that we've built up together over the past three years
over the past;three years
know for sure;where we stand
absence makes;the heart grow fonder
out of;sight
 time and space will;determine our true feelings
painful for;me to leave you
I only have;our best interests at heart
I am confused and;disheartened
hearing things that;become deeply etched upon my mind and heart
phone number is;on the refrigerator
the phone number is;on the refrigerator
experiment in;living without one another
to blame for;all our problems
all our;problems
even when we're;apart
when I come;into the office now
get paid for;overtime there
we can't just;end our relationship
