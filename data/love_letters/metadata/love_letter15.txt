you had;moved out
I couldn't;believe it
you're really;gone
without even;telling me good-bye in person
haven't gotten;in touch with you sooner
I haven't;missed you
you had to;leave me the way you did
giving you;enough of my time
enough time to;us
promising to;cut back my hours
and I really;meant to
feel like;you were in a relationship
ending our;relationship
I was literally;on call
volunteer work;in the pediatric ward
residence at;St. John's
my work at;the hospital
I couldn't;put in anymore overtime
she agreed to;cut back my hours to three twelve-hour shifts
I would only;be coming in to volunteer two hours a week
not wanting;things to end
give us another;chance
I'll prove it;to you
I promise I'll;prove it to you this time
take you;for granted again
You deserve the;best that I can give
willing to;start over
your favorite;food
your choice of;dessert
if you're;interested
When you called;me at work
upset that;you would just leave that way, without even telling me good-bye in person
It's definitely not;that I haven't missed you--believe me, I have
I've taken some;time
I understand why;you felt that you had to leave me the way you did
cut back;my hours
I don't;blame you
as much as I;love my work at the hospital
I've learned my;lesson
I won't ever;take you for granted again
I won't ever;take you for granted
begin by;making your favorite food for dinner--beef enchiladas with all the trimmings--and your choice of dessert
