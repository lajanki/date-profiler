I know that we;just decided (again) to work things out
spending some time;apart
on our;relationship
appreciation for;each other
we decided to;try again
last three weeks;
Things just aren't;working for me
you'll probably;admit that they're not really working for you, either
admit that;they're not really working for you, either
we would get;back together
first started;dating
a few days of;being back together
more than;before
Now we're;hurting each other
blaming;each other
the problems between;us
hazardous to;our mental well-being
not willing to;do it anymore
I really wish;that things could have worked out this time
working through;our problems
see eye-to-eye on;anything
will be;hard on both of us
I regret;the pain this letter will cause you
the only way that;we can find any lasting peace
we can find;any lasting peace
we will both;be much happier
if we just;end things now
we can start;rebuilding our lives
rebuilding our;lives
I wish you;the best
a place in;my heart
some time in;the future
surprised at the;good
take care of;yourself
I just can't;do this anymore
if you're;honest with yourself
 know that;separating again (for good this time) will be hard on both of us
 we're not meant to;be together
