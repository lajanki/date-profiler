I realize I;cannot expect feelings of constant bliss
feelings of constant;bliss
we might be;getting too serious, too quickly
Until we;decide otherwise
Other aspects of;our lives
some time to;focus on our jobs and our studies
focus on;our jobs and our studies
we probably shouldn't;try rushing our feelings
Let's make sure;we are comfortable together first
think about;our relationship
until we;know which direction to pursue
which direction to;pursue
let's not;commit ourselves exclusively to this relationship
take time to;think about our relationship
