really sorry;that things kind of got out of hand
the importance of;budgeting
putting away;money for a rainy day
There are plenty of;things that we do agree on
when it comes to;finances
the importance of;working hard
I'll never have to;worry if you'll pull your own weight
when it comes to;earning a living
such a strong;work ethic
as fast as;you earn it
strong opinions about;some things
we rarely;have disagreements like that one
maybe we;really did just need the time to cool off
ideas about;things
the same about;everything
variety is;the spice of life
not to;take things too seriously
not to take things;too seriously
I apologize;for anything that I said that offended you
I apologize for;anything that I said that offended you
I didn't mean;it
I didn't;mean it
need for;financial security
I love;you
the only thing that;really matters
as long as we;are willing to give our relationship our best efforts
as long as;we are willing to give our relationship our best efforts
willing to give;our relationship our best efforts
thank you for;being so good to me
How about;coming over to my place Friday for dinner
dessert is;negotiable
money for a;rainy day
We have always;talked things out
remember to keep;things in perspective
