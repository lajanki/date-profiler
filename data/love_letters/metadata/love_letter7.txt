Just Like;Heaven
I'm sitting;here at work
express the;way I'm feeling
I can tell you;this
I'm in;love with you
everything about;you
and your;smile
the sound of;your laugh
the warmth of;your body
the smell of;your cologne
the taste of;your lips
all of my;senses
don't want to;be with anyone else
I don't want;to be with anyone else
I feel like I'm;floating
my mouth will;never stop smiling
never stop;smiling
I love talking to;you
even when they;differ from your own
differ from;your own
I feel;special
no one else in;the room
into my;eyes
depths of your;soul
cannot wait to;see you again
the words that;will express the way I'm feeling
I'm in love with;you
I love your;blue eyes
when you hold;me
when you touch;me
I only want;to be with you
I could tell you;anything
I can see into;the depths of your soul
I love the;man that you are
