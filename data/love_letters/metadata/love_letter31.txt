How are things;going
I haven't seen;much of you lately
it seems like;you're upset with me
you have some;reason not to
you haven't;called
You could just;be really busy
If I've;done something to offend you or hurt you
I had a;phone conversation
don't know if;my talking to him might have upset you
we haven't;known each other for very long
ever since;Jan introduced us
The last;month and a half
I never know;what to expect
I never;know what to expect
what to expect;when I'm with you
positive;attitude
such a good;person
I would never;do anything to intentionally cause you pain
do anything to;intentionally cause you pain
Could we;get together and talk
what's on;your mind these days
I can;pack a picnic lunch
we could go;to Taquito's
I know how;you love Mexican food
What do you;say
how things are;going
we can get;together
spending time;together
love for;life
