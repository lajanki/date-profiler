how can;I say this
seeing a lot of;each other lately
you've been;so sweet to me
Each time you;look at me with those big
Please don't;misunderstand
the time we;have spent together
our relationship is;becoming too serious, too quickly for me
I need to date;at a slower pace right now
I have made a;commitment to myself
get in the way of;my graduation
I want to enjoy;dating several guys on a casual basis
I will never;be able to complete my degree
complete my;degree
I failed in;my resolve
entered into;a serious relationship
I'm just not;ready
feel free to;enter into other relationships yourself
time to;settle down
I want to say;that I think you're a great guy
I think you're;a great guy
Do I want to;see you again
without the;expectation of immediate commitment
I've had a;lot of fun with you
I have to;maintain tunnel vision
make my way to;the books
why don't you;could call me in a couple of weeks
let's give it;a breather
Thanks for;understanding
I want to;melt
