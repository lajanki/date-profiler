I don't want to;hurt you
We need to;end this relationship
Maybe we could;try again in the future to make it work
to make it;work
Trying to improve;this relationship
I have been;stressed out
on edge with;everyone around me
I don't like;who I am
focus on;getting back to where I feel happy and at peace with myself and my life
Things have;really worsened
It seems like;we don't talk at all anymore
enough to;even try to talk
it feels;awkward and uncomfortable
it's going to;be a lot healthier for both of us to just to separate
It hurts;me to tell you this
care about;you very deeply
We've had;some great times together
hate to;leave those behind
better off;apart
care about;you
early days of;our life together
how we;feel
try to make;our relationship work again
our lives have;moved in separate directions
we can only;be friends
over the past;few months
remember the;early days of our life together
