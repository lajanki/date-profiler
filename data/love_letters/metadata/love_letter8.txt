lost in;the memory of you
What is;today
Thoughts of;last night
Nothing else seems;worth my time and effort
when we were;together
could no longer;tell where you left off and I began
my love is;lasting
I know it;will never end
it will never;end
There can be no;other woman
I've been involved;in other relationships
compare to;what I have found with you
practice for;the real thing
feelings that;had captured my soul
promised me;freedom and joy
sweet;surrender
I can't stand;being away from you
I hope you;feel the same way
tell me when;can I see you again
when can I;see you again
the memory of;you
I can't remember;
can't remember;
I'm still;lost in everything I felt when we were together
I became;"us"
not sure when;it began
what we;experienced last night
Perhaps the;others were just "dry runs," practice for the real thing,
surrender to;the feelings that had captured my soul
surrender to the;feelings that had captured my soul
I understand;what the "sweet surrender" he sang about really means
You must;know I can't stand being away from you much longer
You must know;I can't stand being away from you much longer
can I see;you again
