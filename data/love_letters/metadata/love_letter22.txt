I don't want you to;think that I'm saying those words lightly
I really mean;them
I am so;sorry
what I did was;wrong
not sure what;I was thinking
I never wanted to;hurt you
I wish I could;take it back
All I can do is;try to show you how much I regret what I've done
try to show you;how much I regret what I've done
we've always been;able to work through them
able to;work through them
stronger because of;them
whatever it takes;for you to trust me again
go back to;the way things were
too many;good times together
full responsibility for;my mistake
give up on;me
when we went;parasailing
we bought our;dog
Remember how;happy we were
Please forgive;me
I want to;see you
start making;it up to you
rent a good;movie
under a big;blanket
enjoy being;together
I'll call you;tonight
ask for your;forgiveness
I hope that this;situation is no different
