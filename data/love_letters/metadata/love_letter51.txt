I know that;you said before that you needed more time
I have tried to;respect that
not sure where;this relationship is going
if it's;going anywhere anymore
started going;out
we seemed to;have so much in common
Was I;wrong
willing to make;a strong commitment
feelings that;I have for you
you keep;putting me off
heading in;the same direction
ready to;plan my future
permanent part of;it
having a;family
You must know;how much I've come to care about you
how much I've;come to care about you
Is there any hope;that you might love me too
I need to know where;you're coming from
I can't wait;forever
we can get;together soon
I hate to think;that you've been leading me along
express the;feelings that I have for you
talk about your;family
