We've been;together now
it's been a;great year
You know I;love you
things have come;to a complete standstill
things have;come to a complete standstill
We're not;moving forward
be a part of;my life
I can't continue;the way things are
what we're;doing
where we're;going
it's time to;set some new goals for our relationship
new goals for;our relationship
take the relationship;a step further
How do you;feel
Do you want;the same thing
Can we talk about;this
Can we;talk about
for almost;a year
come to a;complete standstill
