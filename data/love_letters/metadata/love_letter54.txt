I know it's been;a few days since we talked
I'm sorry I haven't;returned your calls
I just can't;face you right now
how much;your friendship means
we've had a lot of;good times
we've had;a lot of
I can still remember;our parents plotting our marriage when we were
Do you remember;that
plotting our;marriage
we've always;been able to offer each other a listening ear and a shoulder to lean on
I thought I was;over being upset
over being;upset
I'm not quite;to that point yet
in order to give;each other some space
right off the;bat
We were;together
feeling somewhat;betrayed
I don't think that you;had ulterior motives in asking her out
asking her;out
don't really believe;that you would do it to hurt me
I hardly know;what to think
I assumed you;knew how I would feel about that kind of thing
how I would;feel about that kind of thing
going out with;someone so close to me so soon
going out with someone;so close to me so soon
Would you please tell me;what you were thinking
some time to;sort this out
I hope we can;straighten things out soon
can't face;you
best to;see other people
see other;people
