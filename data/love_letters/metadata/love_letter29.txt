didn't get;in touch with you yesterday
surprised when;you got home last night
out of town;on business
things haven't been;going very well between us lately
It seems as;if we fight all the time
try to get;along anymore
Every time;we make an effort to resolve things
end up;flinging insults
We've stopped;really listening to one another
listening to;one another
used to be;so loving and good to each other
count each other's;imperfections
make things;better
nothing seems to;work
blaming you for;what has happened
we're both;at fault
the problems that;we have
don't think;this is a very healthy relationship for either one of us anymore
this is a very;healthy relationship for either one of us anymore
some time to;think about things
try to gain;some perspective
I think we;shouldn't contact each other at all
never forget;the good times that we've shared
Things just aren't;working out right now
remember why;we first got together
better off;just being friends
ending the;relationship
please know that;I love you
I want the;best for you
all we do is;count each other's imperfections
we shouldn't;contact each other
Wishing you;the best
