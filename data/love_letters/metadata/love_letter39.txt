Because we;parted last night in anger
I decided to;write you a letter rather than call
We both needed to;cool off a little
think about what's;happening to us
what's happening to;us
I don't really know;when our arguments first started
we can't seem to;resolve them peacefully
both of us have;hair triggers on our tempers
discuss a;problem
two rational;people
With our;volatile personalities
get angry and;start fighting
when the memory;fades
we start to;miss each other
This behavior is;beginning
pattern that;we can't seem to break
We've been together;for almost five years now
years of;our lives
think twice before;we throw it away
When it is;good
those times are;getting further and further apart
if there's enough;love
I know I still;love you
we could try to;find the road back to the way we were
I'm just afraid;we need someone else to help us do that now
someone else to;help us do that now
need to find;someone who'll show us how to settle our arguments peacefully
how to settle;our arguments peacefully
figure out why;we're arguing in the first place
start to build;new memories as great as the old ones
how you feel about;going to a counselor with me
going to a;counselor with me
hold on to;what we've got
please don't;make me wait a lonely lifetime
