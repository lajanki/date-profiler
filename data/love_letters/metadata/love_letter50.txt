dinner with my;sister
all about;her new boyfriend
all about her;new boyfriend
it hit me;with amazing force
I know about;you
We don't;talk
talk about our;dreams
I don't know why;I didn't realize this before
I thought that;we were just talking less than we used to
we have never;really talked
We spend a lot of;time together
but it doesn't;involve a lot of talking
We go to;movies
we ride our;bikes
things where;talking just isn't involved
don't have time to;even sit down and talk
It's kind of;sad
I enjoy being;with you
is starting to;seem a bit shallow
strengthen what;we have
make it more;secure
want to know about;you
What are your;favorite movies
What is your;favorite candy bar
What was your;family like
tell you about my;life
what happened before;I met you
what I hope for;in the future
Let me make;dinner
we'll just;talk
how little I;know about you
I didn't realize;this before
thinking about;it
 I'd like it;to be a lot deeper
 when you were;growing up
 know more about;me
 instead of watching;a movie
 learning more about;who you really are
