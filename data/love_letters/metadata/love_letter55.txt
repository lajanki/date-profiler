I saw you;
I was at the;mall
both of our;mothers
a car that;looked a lot like yours
until I saw;you walk out of the store, get into the car, and drive away
You told me that;you had to go out of town on business
you had to go;out of town on business
wouldn't be;back
Why did you;lie to me
hard not to;overreact
there's a good;explanation
not sure what;that would be
I thought that we had;a good relationship
we could always;talk to each other
I believed;everything you told me
How can I believe;a word you say
how can we continue;this relationship
I really want you to;explain to me what you were doing Friday night
explain to me;what you were doing Friday night
what you were doing;Friday night
I want to hear your;side of things
I want to know;now
built on;honest communication
I don't want this relationship;to be over
