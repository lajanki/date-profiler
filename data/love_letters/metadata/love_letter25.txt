I have done;it again
accused you of;fooling around
I upset;our relationship
talk about your;co-workers
control my;anger
thinking about what;I am doing or saying
people you;have to work with
only being;pleasant
it seems that;you enjoy these other people too much
not a fair;assessment
I guess I;am over-reacting
I still love;you
I want to;be with you
I want to be;with you
you enjoy;these other people
and I am;sorry
get on;the right track
