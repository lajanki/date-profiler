I care;a great deal about you
will always remember;the fun times that we have had together
I'm worried that;we're going too far, too fast
we're going too;far, too fast
not ready to;make too strong a commitment
a lot to learn about;each other
about previous;relationships
it is best to;take these things slowly
I've made;mistakes
maybe you;have too
don't want;that to happen again
don't want to ruin;that
don't want;to ruin
I still want to;spend time with you
look forward to;spending time with you
I've got to;take things more slowly
Why don't we;try toning things down a little
maybe try;only going out about once a week
time to see;other people
without getting;quickly in way over our heads
won't stop;writing altogether
Take care of;yourself
