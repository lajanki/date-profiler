tell you how;sad I now feel after our argument
after our;argument
my many;faults
the many;pains
wash out;any spot of unhappiness
spot of;unhappiness
I know I have;said hurtful things
I ask you to;forget them
you are a;great person
no right to;put you down
please try to;forgive me
I am very;sorry
give me another;chance
truth is;that you are a great person
