a mission to;find someone that would complete me
find someone that;would complete me
someone that;would complete me
moment that I;met you
never thought that;my task would be fulfilled
my task;would be fulfilled
girl that I had;thought only existed in a fairytale
your gentle;smile
the strength to;make the impossible possible
I am totally;addicted to you
addicted to;you
look into;your eyes
the real;me
a relationship that;will grow to be more than friends some day
declare my;love for you
waiting for;you now
finally found the;perfection
I didn't believe;my eyes
standing in;front of me
staring at;the moon
a person that;lives for a goal and a purpose
a person that lives;for a goal and a purpose
grow to be;more than friends
more than;friends
love for;you
