# I'm Falling For You #

Ever since our first date, I've noticed changes in my world. Work at the office seems easier, and I'm getting more accomplished in less time. My boss has noticed the changes, too, and has been very complimentary of late.

I continue to be pleasantly surprised as I discover more about you, yet there is still so much that I'd like to know. I get excited at the thought of spending more time with you because our time together will help me to learn more about you. Already, I'm learning that we have so much in common. I enjoy our differences, but I'm happy that we share so many similar opinions and experiences. Whatever differences exist can only broaden our horizons and our outlook on life.

I've lost interest in seeing anyone else, Katie, because I'm falling in love with you!

P.S. I hope we can get together Friday evening. I'll call you.
