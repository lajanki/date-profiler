# Let's Part on Good Terms While We Can #

I know that we just decided (again) to work things out, but I just can't do this anymore. I had hoped that spending some time apart would help us gain a new perspective on our relationship and a greater appreciation for each other. When we decided to try again, I really thought that it had at first, but these last three weeks have proven otherwise. Things just aren't working for me and, if you're honest with yourself, you'll probably admit that they're not really working for you, either.

I had hoped that we would get back together and treat each other as we did when we first started dating. We treated each other so well then and put each other first in the relationship. We didn't let little things come between us then, either. After a few days of being back together, we're already squabbling again about stupid things--even more than before, it seems. Now we're hurting each other all over again and blaming each other for the problems between us.

I know that living this way is hazardous to our mental well-being, and I'm not willing to do it anymore. I'm sorry. I really wish that things could have worked out this time. But we're not any better at working through our problems than we were before--we just don't seem to be able to understand each other or see eye-to-eye on anything. Whatever common ground we once shared has eroded.

I know that separating again (for good this time) will be hard on both of us. I regret the pain this letter will cause you, but it's the only way that we can find any lasting peace. I honestly believe we will both be much happier in the long run if we just end things now. It's clear we're not meant to be together, and the sooner we accept it, the sooner we can start rebuilding our lives.

I wish you the best, I really do. You'll always have a place in my heart. Maybe we can get together some time in the future, maybe this time next year, and catch each other up on our lives. We may be very surprised at the good that may come from this. Whatever happens, good luck, and take care of yourself.
