# Sorry We Didn't Agree #

This is hard for me to do because I am not good at saying I am sorry. We were having a lot of fun, and I know that I care for you very much, and I want to go on seeing you and being with you. Now I feel like I just want to start over and forget all of those angry words we both said.

Maybe this is just one of those lovers' quarrels that we hear about. We both said hurtful things. I did not like when you said that I am trying to control you. I was only trying to help you make up your mind about our relationship. I really love you and want to be with you.

If you feel the same way, let us make up and try to put this behind us.

I will call you unless I receive an email saying that you don't want to hear from me. I hope you do want to get together and make up.

Love and kisses.
