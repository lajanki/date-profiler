# We Need To Slow Down #

I want you to know how much I appreciate our friendship and how much I enjoy spending time with you. I'm concerned, though, that we may be rushing into our relationship. After all, we're just getting to know each other, and I've learned from sad experience not to rush into anything too quickly. More than once I've jumped into deep waters and found that I couldn't swim. I don't want that to happen to either one of us. We're moving too fast right now, and I'm starting to feel pressured to commit to a level of trust and intimacy I'm not ready for. I want you to understand this, because I know you will respect my feelings. I'm thinking that you may be feeling the same way.

I am at a point in my life where I still want to explore different possibilities, including having the freedom to date other people. You need to understand that I'm just not ready for an exclusive relationship, but don't get me wrong--I want to keep seeing you. If we are really right for each other, then slowing down and dating others will make us even more aware of how compatible we are.

I've thought about this a lot, and I'm convinced that taking things slowly will benefit both of us. I need to focus on completing my nursing degree and I understand that you are working towards getting promoted into management. The way we are doing things now, though, my grades have started to suffer and, from what you've said, I don't think things aren't going so smoothly for you, either.

I think we should slow down a little and see each other every couple of weeks for a while. Let's take our time to get to know each other better. Our relationship has so much potential, but I want to take things slow and easy.

Thanks for understanding and being sensitive to my feelings.
