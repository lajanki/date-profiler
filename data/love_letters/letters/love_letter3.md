# Could It Be #

I remember the day we met. You stole my heart and made it skip a beat. You have been the highlight of my life ever since then. When I sleep, I dream of you. When I work, we work together. When your heart beats, mine beats with yours.

We have been friends for some time now; not one day has gone by without my thinking of you. And when I do think of you, the biggest smile comes across my face.

I feel warm all over, and my heart skips a beat whether we're on the phone or just in the same room. Sweetheart, just looking into your eyes makes me remember the first day we met. I have the same dream we both want, and that is for both of us to fall in love with our best friend. I fell for you so long ago. Do you feel the same way about me?
