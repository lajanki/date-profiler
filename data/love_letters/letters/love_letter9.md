# I Really Miss You #

You've been gone for two weeks now. I look at the calendar and know that it's only 14 days, but those 14 days feel so much longer! We've never been separated from each other for this long before. I knew that it would be difficult, and I knew that I would miss you, but I didn't realize how difficult being separated from you this long would really be!

The worst part is at night. I put off going to bed as long as I can, but eventually I have to end up in bed all alone. When I reach my arm out for you in the night, there's nobody there. I only feel a cold sheet. Although I thought I might like being able to have all of the blankets, I would give them up in a heartbeat if you were just next to me again. I have no one to say goodnight to, no one to kiss before turning out the light, and no one to tell what my day was like at supper time. Talking on the phone is just not the same as talking to you in person with my arm around you.

When exactly are you coming home? I can't wait to see you again. When I pick you up at the airport, we can go out to dinner. I want to hear all about your trip, about what went right and what went wrong. I want to hear about your hotel and the room service, about the weather, about the people you worked with while you were there. I want to hear every little detail. I have a lot to tell you, too.

I'm so excited to see you again, to talk to you, and to hold you. We can snuggle up on the couch and watch that new movie that's out on video that we've been looking forward to. I just need to be with you again. Please come home soon.
