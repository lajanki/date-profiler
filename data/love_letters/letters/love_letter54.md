# You Really Hurt Me #

I know it's been a few days since we talked, and I'm sorry I haven't returned your calls, but I just can't face you right now. Please know how much your friendship means to me--how much you mean to me. We've known each other for so long now and we've had a lot of good times over the years. I can still remember our parents plotting our marriage when we were in kindergarten. Do you remember that? Since then, we've always been able to offer each other a listening ear and a shoulder to lean on.

I thought I was over being upset, but I'm not quite to that point yet. I know that we had decided that it would be best to see other people for the time being in order to give each other some space. It really hurts me, though, that you would ask my roommate out right off the bat. We were together for a long time, and I can't help feeling somewhat betrayed.

Now, I don't think that you had ulterior motives in asking her out. I don't really believe that you would do it to hurt me, either, but I couldn't believe it when Christine told me that you had asked her out and that the two of you went to dinner on Tuesday. I'm confused right now, and I hardly know what to think. I assumed you knew how I would feel about that kind of thing--about going out with someone so close to me so soon. Would you please tell me what you were thinking?

I might need some time to sort this out before we see each other again, but I hope we can straighten things out soon.
