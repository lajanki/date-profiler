# We Need To Slow Down #

Although I realize I cannot expect feelings of constant bliss, I am beginning to worry that we might be getting too serious, too quickly.

Until we decide otherwise, let's not commit ourselves exclusively to this relationship. Instead, let's remain free to date others. Other aspects of our lives need our attention, too, so let's take some time to focus on our jobs and our studies.

I'm sure you will agree that we probably shouldn't try rushing our feelings. Let's make sure we are comfortable together first, and let's also take time to think about our relationship.

Maybe we can see each other less often, at least until we know which direction to pursue.
