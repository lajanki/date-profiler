# That Was A Stupid Thing I Said #

I'm sorry we fought last night. It was my fault. I take full responsibility. I'd had a bad day and ended up taking it out on you. Sometimes I get so worked up and then I say things that I don't really mean. I end up opening my mouth without thinking, and that's never a good thing.

I'm normally a very calm and rational person. You know that what I did was unusual for me. Of course, that doesn't make it right, but at least it doesn't normally happen. I hope you can forgive me. I love you. I love us. I love the way we work together and enjoy each other's company.

I remember how, early in our relationship, your sister did something really stupid. I can't even remember what it was, but you were very upset about it. I remember how she called you to talk about it and apologize and how you expressed your forgiveness. I loved you all the more at that moment because I recognized what a kind and forgiving man you are. I hope you can be that forgiving with me when I occasionally get unreasonable and say things that I don't mean.

I was able to get tickets to that hockey game you wanted to see on Saturday night. Let's go have fun and forget that this ever happened. I'm hoping I can pick you up at 5.
