# I'll Do Whatever It Takes #

I remember exactly where I was when you told me you were leaving. I was sitting in the chaise by the fireplace. I was reading that new Mary Higgins Clark mystery. I remember that I was wearing my black skirt and green cardigan. I don't know why I remember all the details. But the detail that I remember the most was how I felt. I felt as if my heart jumped and turned over and I was left with this cold fear in the pit of my stomach.

I can't say that I was totally surprised. Our relationship had been suffering for awhile, but I naively thought that because we loved each other, it would get better with time. I thought it was just a bump in the road that we would get over.

Since you've been gone, though, I've thought a lot about it, and realize now that things were worse than I let myself believe. I knew that you weren't happy. Instead of trying to talk about it and deal with it, I chose to brush it under the rug and hoped that it would go away on its own. But instead, you went away. I realize now how selfish I was and how I always considered my own wants and needs before yours.

I want you to come back. I am willing to put forth whatever effort required to make things work. Let's talk about it. Let's go see a counselor if you think that's a good idea. I promise that things will be different this time. I'll focus on being much less selfish and considering your wants, your needs and your feelings. I know I may not have always acted like it, but I love you. I love you more now since the separation because I realize what I had and how much I have lost.

Please, let's meet and talk about it. Let's meet at the city park where we had our first date. I'll pack a picnic lunch and we can talk about getting back together. I really want to see you again. How about Saturday at 2 pm? I'll be waiting for you under that large willow tree.
