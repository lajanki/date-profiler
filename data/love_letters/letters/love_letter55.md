# You Really Hurt Me #

I saw you last night. It was Friday night and I was at the mall shopping for Mother's Day presents for both of our mothers. I saw a car that looked a lot like yours in the parking lot by Sears, but I didn't think anything of it until I saw you walk out of the store, get into the car, and drive away. I sat there in the driver's seat, stunned. You told me that you had to go out of town on business. Your flight left Friday morning and you wouldn't be back until Sunday.

I don't understand. Why did you lie to me? I'm trying so hard not to overreact. I want to believe that there's a good explanation, although I'm not sure what that would be. I thought that we had a good relationship and that we could always talk to each other. I trusted you. I believed everything you told me. How can I believe a word you say now? And how can we continue this relationship if it isn't built on honest communication and mutual trust and respect?

I really want you to explain to me what you were doing Friday night. I want to hear your side of things. I don't want this relationship to be over, but if it is, I want to know now. Please call me.
