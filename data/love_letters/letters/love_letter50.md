# We Never Really Talk #

I had dinner with my sister last night. She was telling me all about her new boyfriend and, all of a sudden, it hit me with amazing force how little I know about you. We don't talk. We make small talk about our days and the weather, but we don't talk about our dreams, our feelings, or our past. I don't know why I didn't realize this before. At first I thought that we were just talking less than we used to, but now I think that we have never really talked. As I sit here thinking about it now, I can't think of one conversation we ever had that had any import to it at all.

We spend a lot of time together, but it doesn't involve a lot of talking. We go to movies, we ride our bikes, and we kayak. We do things where talking just isn't involved. And our lives are so busy that we don't have time to even sit down and talk on a daily basis. It's kind of sad.

I enjoy being with you, but our relationship is starting to seem a bit shallow. I'd like it to be a lot deeper. I'd like to learn more with you--about everything. I think that communication could really strengthen what we have and make it more secure. There are so many things that I want to know about you! What is your favorite candy bar? What are your favorite movies and favorite songs? What was your family like when you were growing up? What are your siblings like?

And I'd like for you to know more about me. I want to be able to tell you about my life: what happened before I met you, and what I hope for in the future. I think it will bring us closer together to talk about these things. What do you think? Let me make dinner Friday night. You can come over and, instead of watching a movie, we'll just talk. I'm looking forward to learning more about who you really are and sharing more about me.
